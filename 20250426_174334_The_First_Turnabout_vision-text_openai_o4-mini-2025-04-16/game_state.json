Well, I have to say lawyer 1, I'm impressed! Not everyone takes on a murder trial right off the bat like this. It says a lot about you... and your client as well.\nlawyer 1: Um... thanks. Actually, it's because I owe him a favor.\nmentor 1: A favor? You mean, you knew defendant 1 before this case?\nlawyer 1: Yes. Actually, I kind of owe my current job to him. He's one of the reasons I became an attorney.\nmentor 1: Well, that's news to me!\nlawyer 1: I want to help him out any way I can! I just... really want to help him. I owe him that much.\n???: (It's over! My life, everything, it's all over!)\nmentor 1: ... Is that your client screaming over there?\nlawyer 1: Yeah... it's him.\n???: (Death! Despair! Ohhhh! I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna die!!!)\nmentor 1: It sounds like he wants to die...\nlawyer 1: Um, yeah. *sigh*\nButz: Nick!!!\nlawyer 1: Hey. Hey there, Larry.\nButz: Dude, I'm so guilty!! Tell them I'm guilty!!! Gimme the death sentence! I ain't afraid to die!\nlawyer 1: What!? What's wrong, Larry?\nButz: Oh, it's all over... I... I'm finished. Finished! I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?\nlawyer 1: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)\nlawyer 1: My name is lawyer 1 lawyer 1. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: defendant 1... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!\nScene: August 3, 10:00 AM\nScene: District Court\nScene: Courtroom No. 2\njudge 1: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. defendant 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 is ready, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: The, um, defense is ready, judge 1.\njudge 1: Ahem. lawyer 1? This is your first trial, is it not?\nlawyer 1: Y-Yes, judge 1. I'm, um, a little nervous.\njudge 1: Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.\nlawyer 1: Thank... thank you, judge 1.\njudge 1: ... lawyer 1, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\nlawyer 1: Yes, judge 1. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\njudge 1: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of defendant 1 in this case.\nlawyer 1: defendant 1? Well, that's defendant 1, judge 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's victim 1's name?\nlawyer 1: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)\nmentor 1: lawyer 1! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know victim 1's name!?\nlawyer 1: Oh, victim 1! O-Of course I know victim 1's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1. Is it not true that victim 1 had recently dumped you?\nButz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!\nButz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, victim 1's E4. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.\nNarration: E4 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.\nButz: Dude... no way...\nprosecutor 1: victim 1 was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw defendant 1 fleeing the scene of the crime!\njudge 1: Order! Order in judge 1! prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: (This is bad...)\nprosecutor 1: On the day of the murder, my witness 1 was selling newspapers at victim 1's building. Please bring Mr. witness 1 to the stand!\nprosecutor 1: witness 1, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?\nwitness 1: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!\njudge 1: witness 1, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell judge 1 what you saw on the day of the murder.\nwitness 1: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nwitness 1: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nwitness 1: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nwitness 1: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nwitness 1: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nwitness 1: I thought to call the police immediately!\nwitness 1: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nwitness 1: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nwitness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nwitness 1: The man who ran was, without a doubt, defendant 1 sitting right over there.\njudge 1: Hmm...\nlawyer 1: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that witness 1 used was one of those. judge 1... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.\nNarration: E5 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Now, lawyer 1...\nlawyer 1: Yes! Er... yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: You may begin your cross-examination.\nlawyer 1: C-Cross-examination, judge 1?\nmentor 1: Alright, lawyer 1, this is it. The real deal!\nlawyer 1: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?\nmentor 1: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony witness 1 1 just gave!\nlawyer 1: Lies! What?! He was lying!?\nmentor 1: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness 1 must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?\nlawyer 1: !!! How do I prove he's not?\nmentor 1: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare witness 1 1's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between judge 1 Record and witness 1 1's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in witness 1 1's face!\nlawyer 1: Um... okay.\nmentor 1: Open judge 1 Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!\n\n        Cross-Examination Conversation Context:\n        witness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\n\n        Previous 7 manipulations:\n        \n\n        Collected Evidences:\n        ",

And that's just what I'm going to do!\nScene: August 3, 10:00 AM\nScene: District Court\nScene: Courtroom No. 2\njudge 1: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. defendant 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 is ready, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: The, um, defense is ready, judge 1.\njudge 1: Ahem. lawyer 1? This is your first trial, is it not?\nlawyer 1: Y-Yes, judge 1. I'm, um, a little nervous.\njudge 1: Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.\nlawyer 1: Thank... thank you, judge 1.\njudge 1: ... lawyer 1, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\nlawyer 1: Yes, judge 1. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\njudge 1: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of defendant 1 in this case.\nlawyer 1: defendant 1? Well, that's defendant 1, judge 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's victim 1's name?\nlawyer 1: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)\nmentor 1: lawyer 1! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know victim 1's name!?\nlawyer 1: Oh, victim 1! O-Of course I know victim 1's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1. Is it not true that victim 1 had recently dumped you?\nButz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!\nButz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, victim 1's E4. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.\nNarration: E4 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.\nButz: Dude... no way...\nprosecutor 1: victim 1 was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw defendant 1 fleeing the scene of the crime!\njudge 1: Order! Order in judge 1! prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: (This is bad...)\nprosecutor 1: On the day of the murder, my witness 1 was selling newspapers at victim 1's building. Please bring Mr. witness 1 to the stand!\nprosecutor 1: witness 1, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?\nwitness 1: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!\njudge 1: witness 1, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell judge 1 what you saw on the day of the murder.\nwitness 1: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nwitness 1: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nwitness 1: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nwitness 1: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nwitness 1: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nwitness 1: I thought to call the police immediately!\nwitness 1: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nwitness 1: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nwitness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nwitness 1: The man who ran was, without a doubt, defendant 1 sitting right over there.\njudge 1: Hmm...\nlawyer 1: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that witness 1 used was one of those. judge 1... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.\nNarration: E5 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Now, lawyer 1...\nlawyer 1: Yes! Er... yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: You may begin your cross-examination.\nlawyer 1: C-Cross-examination, judge 1?\nmentor 1: Alright, lawyer 1, this is it. The real deal!\nlawyer 1: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?\nmentor 1: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony witness 1 1 just gave!\nlawyer 1: Lies! What?! He was lying!?\nmentor 1: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness 1 must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?\nlawyer 1: !!! How do I prove he's not?\nmentor 1: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare witness 1 1's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between judge 1 Record and witness 1 1's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in witness 1 1's face!\nlawyer 1: Um... okay.\nmentor 1: Open judge 1 Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!\n\n        Cross-Examination Conversation Context:\n        witness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nlawyer 1: 1:00 PM!

Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's victim 1's name?\nlawyer 1: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)\nmentor 1: lawyer 1! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know victim 1's name!?\nlawyer 1: Oh, victim 1! O-Of course I know victim 1's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1. Is it not true that victim 1 had recently dumped you?\nButz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!\nButz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, victim 1's E4. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.\nNarration: E4 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.\nButz: Dude... no way...\nprosecutor 1: victim 1 was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw defendant 1 fleeing the scene of the crime!\njudge 1: Order! Order in judge 1! prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: (This is bad...)\nprosecutor 1: On the day of the murder, my witness 1 was selling newspapers at victim 1's building. Please bring Mr. witness 1 to the stand!\nprosecutor 1: witness 1, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?\nwitness 1: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!\njudge 1: witness 1, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell judge 1 what you saw on the day of the murder.\nwitness 1: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nwitness 1: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nwitness 1: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nwitness 1: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nwitness 1: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nwitness 1: I thought to call the police immediately!\nwitness 1: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nwitness 1: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nwitness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nwitness 1: The man who ran was, without a doubt, defendant 1 sitting right over there.\njudge 1: Hmm...\nlawyer 1: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that witness 1 used was one of those. judge 1... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.\nNarration: E5 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Now, lawyer 1...\nlawyer 1: Yes!

He was lying!?\nmentor 1: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness 1 must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?\nlawyer 1: !!! How do I prove he's not?\nmentor 1: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare witness 1 1's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between judge 1 Record and witness 1 1's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in witness 1 1's face!\nlawyer 1: Um... okay.\nmentor 1: Open judge 1 Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!\n\n        Cross-Examination Conversation Context:\n        witness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nlawyer 1: 1:00 PM!

I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1.

We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men!

It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body.

Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1...

I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\nlawyer 1: Yes, judge 1. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\njudge 1: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of defendant 1 in this case.\nlawyer 1: defendant 1? Well, that's defendant 1, judge 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's victim 1's name?\nlawyer 1: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)\nmentor 1: lawyer 1! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know victim 1's name!?\nlawyer 1: Oh, victim 1! O-Of course I know victim 1's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1. Is it not true that victim 1 had recently dumped you?\nButz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!\nButz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, victim 1's E4. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.\nNarration: E4 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.\nButz: Dude... no way...\nprosecutor 1: victim 1 was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw defendant 1 fleeing the scene of the crime!\njudge 1: Order! Order in judge 1! prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: (This is bad...)\nprosecutor 1: On the day of the murder, my witness 1 was selling newspapers at victim 1's building. Please bring Mr. witness 1 to the stand!\nprosecutor 1: witness 1, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?\nwitness 1: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!\njudge 1: witness 1, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell judge 1 what you saw on the day of the murder.\nwitness 1: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nwitness 1: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nwitness 1: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nwitness 1: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nwitness 1: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nwitness 1: I thought to call the police immediately!\nwitness 1: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nwitness 1: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nwitness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nwitness 1: The man who ran was, without a doubt, defendant 1 sitting right over there.\njudge 1: Hmm...\nlawyer 1: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that witness 1 used was one of those. judge 1... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.\nNarration: E5 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Now, lawyer 1...\nlawyer 1: Yes! Er... yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: You may begin your cross-examination.\nlawyer 1: C-Cross-examination, judge 1?\nmentor 1: Alright, lawyer 1, this is it. The real deal!\nlawyer 1: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?\nmentor 1: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony witness 1 1 just gave!\nlawyer 1: Lies! What?! He was lying!?\nmentor 1: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness 1 must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?\nlawyer 1: !!! How do I prove he's not?\nmentor 1: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare witness 1 1's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between judge 1 Record and witness 1 1's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in witness 1 1's face!\nlawyer 1: Um... okay.\nmentor 1: Open judge 1 Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!\n\n        Cross-Examination Conversation Context:\n        witness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nlawyer 1: 1:00 PM!

A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: defendant 1... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one.

I can't live in a world without her! I can't! Who... who took her away from me, Nick? Who did this!? Aww, Nick, ya gotta tell me! Who took my baby away!?\nlawyer 1: (Hmm... The person responsible for your girlfriend's death? The newspapers say it was you...)\nlawyer 1: My name is lawyer 1 lawyer 1. Here's the story: My first case is a fairly simple one. A young woman was killed in her apartment. The guy they arrested was the unlucky sap dating her: defendant 1... my best friend since grade school. Our school had a saying: \"When something smells, it's usually the Butz.\" In the 23 years I've known him, it's usually been true. He has a knack for getting himself in trouble. One thing I can say though: it's usually not his fault. He just has terrible luck. But I know better than anyone, that he's a good guy at heart. That and I owe him one. Which is why I took the case... to clear his name. And that's just what I'm going to do!\nScene: August 3, 10:00 AM\nScene: District Court\nScene: Courtroom No. 2\njudge 1: Court is now in session for the trial of Mr. defendant 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 is ready, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: The, um, defense is ready, judge 1.\njudge 1: Ahem. lawyer 1? This is your first trial, is it not?\nlawyer 1: Y-Yes, judge 1. I'm, um, a little nervous.\njudge 1: Your conduct during this trial will decide the fate of your client. Murder is a serious charge. For your client's sake, I hope you can control your nerves.\nlawyer 1: Thank... thank you, judge 1.\njudge 1: ... lawyer 1, given the circumstances... I think we should have a test to ascertain your readiness.\nlawyer 1: Yes, judge 1. (Gulp... Hands shaking... Eyesight... fading...)\njudge 1: The test will consist of a few simple questions. Answer them clearly and concisely. Please state the name of defendant 1 in this case.\nlawyer 1: defendant 1? Well, that's defendant 1, judge 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Just keep your wits about you and you'll do fine. Next question: This is a murder trial. Tell me, what's victim 1's name?\nlawyer 1: (Whew, I know this one! Glad I read the case report cover to cover so many times. It's... wait... Uh-oh! No... no way! I forgot! I'm drawing a total blank here!)\nmentor 1: lawyer 1! Are you absolutely SURE you're up to this? You don't even know victim 1's name!?\nlawyer 1: Oh, victim 1! O-Of course I know victim 1's name! I, um, just forgot. ...Temporarily.\nmentor 1: I think I feel a migraine coming on. Look, victim 1's name is listed in judge 1 Record. Just press [the R Button / Tab] to check it at any time, okay? Remember to check it often. Do it for me, please. I'm begging you.\njudge 1: lawyer 1. Who is victim 1 in this case?\nlawyer 1: Um... victim 1's name is victim 1.\njudge 1: Correct. Now, tell me, what was the cause of death? She died because she was...?\nlawyer 1: She was struck once, by a blunt object.\njudge 1: Correct. You've answered all my questions. I see no reason why we shouldn't proceed. You seem much more relaxed, lawyer 1. Good for you.\nlawyer 1: Thank you, judge 1. (Because I don't FEEL relaxed, that's for sure.)\njudge 1: Well, then... First, a question for prosecutor 1. prosecutor 1?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: As lawyer 1 just told us, victim 1 was struck with a blunt object. Would you explain to judge 1 just what that \"object\" was?\nprosecutor 1: The murder weapon was this E3 of \"The Thinker.\" It was found lying on the floor, next to victim 1.\njudge 1: I see... judge 1 accepts it into evidence.\nNarration: E3 added to judge 1 Record.\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... Be sure to pay attention to any evidence added during the trial. That evidence is the only ammunition you have in court. Use [the R Button / Tab] to check judge 1 Record frequently.\njudge 1: prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its first witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: prosecutor 1 calls defendant 1, defendant 1, to the stand.\nlawyer 1: Um, mentor 1, what do I do now?\nmentor 1: Pay attention. You don't want to miss any information that might help your client's case. You'll get your chance to respond to prosecutor 1 later, so be ready! Let's just hope he doesn't say anything... unfortunate.\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh, Larry gets excited easily... This could be bad.)\nprosecutor 1: Ahem. defendant 1. Is it not true that victim 1 had recently dumped you?\nButz: Hey, watch it buddy! We were great together! We were Romeo and Juliet, Cleopatra and Mark Anthony!\nlawyer 1: (Um... didn't they all die?)\nButz: I wasn't dumped! She just wasn't taking my phone calls. Or seeing me... Ever. WHAT'S IT TO YOU, ANYWAY!?\nprosecutor 1: defendant 1, what you describe is generally what we mean by \"dumped.\" In fact, she had completely abandoned you... and was seeing other men! She had just returned from overseas with one of them the day before the murder!\nButz: Whaddya mean, \"one of them\"!? Lies! All of it, lies! I don't believe a word of it!\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, victim 1's E4. According to this, she was in Paris until the day before she died.\nNarration: E4 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Hmm... Indeed, she appears to have returned the day before the murder.\nButz: Dude... no way...\nprosecutor 1: victim 1 was a model, but did not have a large income. It appears that she had several \"Sugar Daddies.\"\nButz: Daddies? Sugar?\nprosecutor 1: Yes. Older men, who gave her money and gifts. She took their money and used it to support her lifestyle.\nButz: Duuude!\nprosecutor 1: We can clearly see what kind of woman this victim 1 was. Tell me, defendant 1, what do you think of her now?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1... I don't think you want him to answer that question.\nlawyer 1: (Yeah... Larry has a way of running his mouth in all the wrong directions. Should I...?)\nButz: I'm gonna die. I'm just gonna drop dead! Yeah, and when I meet her in the afterlife... I'm going to get to the bottom of this!\njudge 1: Let's continue with the trial, shall we?\nprosecutor 1: I believe the accused's motive is clear to everyone.\njudge 1: Yes, quite.\nlawyer 1: (Oh boy. This is so not looking good.)\nprosecutor 1: Next question! You went to victim 1's apartment on the day of the murder, did you not?\nButz: Gulp!\nprosecutor 1: Well, did you, or did you not?\nButz: Heh? Heh heh. Well, maybe I did, and maybe I didn't!\nlawyer 1: (Uh oh. He went. What do I do?)\njudge 1: Well, that simplifies matters. Who is your witness 1?\nprosecutor 1: The man who found victim 1's body. Just before making the gruesome discovery... He saw defendant 1 fleeing the scene of the crime!\njudge 1: Order! Order in judge 1! prosecutor 1, prosecutor 1 may call its witness 1.\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1.\nlawyer 1: (This is bad...)\nprosecutor 1: On the day of the murder, my witness 1 was selling newspapers at victim 1's building. Please bring Mr. witness 1 to the stand!\nprosecutor 1: witness 1, you sell newspaper subscriptions, is this correct?\nwitness 1: Oh, oh yes! Newspapers, yes!\njudge 1: witness 1, you may proceed with your testimony. Please tell judge 1 what you saw on the day of the murder.\nwitness 1: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.\nwitness 1: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.\nwitness 1: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.\nwitness 1: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!\nwitness 1: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.\nwitness 1: I thought to call the police immediately!\nwitness 1: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.\nwitness 1: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.\nwitness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nwitness 1: The man who ran was, without a doubt, defendant 1 sitting right over there.\njudge 1: Hmm...\nlawyer 1: (Larry! Why didn't you tell the truth? I can't defend you against a testimony like that!)\njudge 1: Incidentally, why wasn't the phone in victim 1's apartment working?\nprosecutor 1: judge 1, at the time of the murder, there was a blackout in the building.\njudge 1: Aren't phones supposed to work during a blackout?\nprosecutor 1: Yes, judge 1... However, some cordless phones do not function normally. The phone that witness 1 used was one of those. judge 1... I have a record of the blackout, for your perusal.\nNarration: E5 added to judge 1 Record.\njudge 1: Now, lawyer 1...\nlawyer 1: Yes! Er... yes, judge 1?\njudge 1: You may begin your cross-examination.\nlawyer 1: C-Cross-examination, judge 1?\nmentor 1: Alright, lawyer 1, this is it. The real deal!\nlawyer 1: Uh... what exactly am I supposed to do?\nmentor 1: Why, you expose the lies in the testimony witness 1 1 just gave!\nlawyer 1: Lies! What?! He was lying!?\nmentor 1: Your client is innocent, right? Then that witness 1 must have lied in his testimony! Or is your client really... guilty?\nlawyer 1: !!! How do I prove he's not?\nmentor 1: You hold the key! It's in the evidence! Compare witness 1 1's testimony to the evidence at hand. There's bound to be a contradiction in there! First, find contradictions between judge 1 Record and witness 1 1's testimony. Then, once you've found the contradicting evidence... present it and rub it in witness 1 1's face!\nlawyer 1: Um... okay.\nmentor 1: Open judge 1 Record with [the R Button / Tab], then point out contradictions in the testimony!\n\n        Cross-Examination Conversation Context:\n        witness 1: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.\nlawyer 1: 1:00 PM! Are you certain?\nwitness 1: Yes. Absolutely.\nlawyer 1: (Hmm... He seems really confident.)\nmentor 1: 1:00 PM?\nmentor 1: lawyer 1. Doesn’t that seem strange to you?\nmentor 1: Present some evidence to contradict him!\n\n        Previous 7 manipulations:\n        game_state: Cross-Examination\ncurrent_statement: {'name': 'witness 1', 'text': 'I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.'}\nmove: l\nthought: Cause: There’s no evidence in judge 1 Record about the exact time of the blackout or any timestamp that directly contradicts witness 1 1’s claim of “1:00 PM.” Without a specific contradiction in evidence, I need to press witness 1 1 for more detail about how he arrived at that exact time; Evidence: E3, E4, and E5 are in the record but none specify a timestamp that conflicts with “1:00 PM”; Effect: By questioning the reliability of his time estimate, I may uncover an inconsistency or forced guess that can be challenged later; Reflection: This maintains the standard cross-examination process by seeking more testimony before attempting to present any evidence.\ngame_state: Conversation\ncurrent_statement: {'name': 'lawyer 1', 'text': '1:00 PM!
