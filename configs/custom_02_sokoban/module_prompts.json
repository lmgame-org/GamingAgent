Report their locations and specify if they are on a Target (becomes character `+`) or Floor (character `@`).\n2.  **Boxes (`$` or `*`):** Identify all box instances. Report their locations and specify for each if it is on a Target (becomes character `*`) or Floor (character `$`)\n3.  **Empty Targets (`?`):** Identify the locations of all Target squares that are currently empty (character `?`).\n4.  **Walls (`#`):** Identify the locations of all Wall segments (character `#`).\n5.  **Floor Spaces (` `):** Implicitly, any square not occupied by the above is a Floor space (character ` `). You don't need to list all floor spaces, but be aware of them for context.\n\nDescribe the board by listing the coordinates for each type of element.
