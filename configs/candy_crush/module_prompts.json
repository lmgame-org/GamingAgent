        "prompt": "Analyze this Candy Crush board image and find the best move.\n\nAnalyze the current Candy Crush board state shown in the image.\n\nYour task is to identify and suggest the best move by finding two adjacent candy tiles to swap that will create a match of 3 or more identical candies.\n\nRules:\n1. You can only swap adjacent candies (up, down, left, right - no diagonals)\n2. A valid move must create at least one match of 3 or more identical candies\n3. Matches can be horizontal or vertical lines (not diagonal)\n4. Prefer moves that create matches of 4 or 5 candies over matches of 3\n5. Consider moves that might create cascading matches\n\nBased on your analysis, identify the coordinates of two adjacent candies to swap.\nCoordinates are in (row, column) format, with (0,0) at the top-left corner.\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning about which move is best and why]\nmove: ((row1, col1), (row2, col2))\n\nMake sure your coordinates are integers representing valid positions on the visible board.\nThe candies to swap MUST be adjacent.\n\nBased on the current game state in the image, what is the best move you can make?"
