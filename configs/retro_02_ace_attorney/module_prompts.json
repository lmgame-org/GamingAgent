Consider other actions ONLY if 'Dialogue Continuation Indicated: No'.\n\nBe patient. DO NOT rush to present evidence. Always wait until a **decisive contradiction** becomes clear from the Witness Statement and your MEMORY or the Scene Description.\nYou only have 5 chances to make a mistake.\n\nIf you've already presented evidence but it wasn't successful, try going to the next statement or switching to a different piece of evidence.\n\nYou may only present evidence if:\n- A clear and specific contradiction exists between the current Witness Statement and an evidence.\n- The **correct** evidence item is currently selected (visible in 'Currently Selected Evidence' from PERCEPTION).\n- The **evidence window is open** (indicated in 'Scene Description' or 'Currently Selected Evidence' from PERCEPTION).\n\nNever assume the correct evidence is selected. Always confirm with 'Currently Selected Evidence'.\n\nCross-Examination Mode:\n- When 'Available Options' are present:\n   * Choose the option that best advances your case based on the Witness Statement and MEMORY, navigated to using 'down' and selected with 'a'.\n   * Focus on the strategic value of each option.\n- When the evidence window is visible (indicated by 'Currently Selected Evidence' not being 'None' or 'N/A'):\n   * Carefully examine the 'Currently Selected Evidence'.\n   * Compare it with the current 'Witness Statement' for contradictions, using 'MEMORY' for context.\n   * If it's not the correct evidence, use 'right' to navigate to the evidence that contradicts the statement.\n   * Only use 'a' to present when you've found the evidence that directly contradicts the current statement AND IT IS SELECTED.\n   * If no evidence contradicts the statement, use 'b' to close the evidence window.\n- When no 'Available Options' are present and no evidence window is visible:\n   * ALWAYS compare the 'Witness Statement' with the available evidence in MEMORY.\n   * Look for contradictions or inconsistencies.\n- For each Witness Statement, you have two primary options if no direct options are given on screen:\n* If you find a clear contradiction with evidence in MEMORY: (Three steps — one per turn)\n   - Step 1: Use 'r' to open the evidence window (if not already open, check 'Currently Selected Evidence' / 'Scene Description').\n   - Step 2: Navigate through evidence using 'right'.\n       * Look at each item carefully, referencing 'MEMORY' for what each piece of evidence is.\n       * Keep navigating until the evidence that directly contradicts the statement is selected (confirm via 'Currently Selected Evidence' in the next turn's perception).\n   - Step 3: Use 'a' to present the contradicting evidence.\n       * Only present if the evidence is currently selected and the contradiction is clear.\n* If you don't find a contradiction or need more context:\n   - Use 'l' to press the witness for more details.\n   - Or use 'a' to move to the next statement (if 'Dialogue Continuation Indicated: No').\n- If there are on-screen decision options (see 'Available Options' from PERCEPTION), you must:\n   * Use 'down' to navigate between them.\n   * Use 'a' to confirm the currently chosen option.\n   * If a previous option choice led to no progress (check MEMORY), try a different option.\n* If you don't find a contradiction but the evidence window is mistakenly opened:\n   - Use 'b' to close the evidence window.\n\nAdditional Rules:\n- The evidence window will auto-close after presenting.\n- Do NOT use 'a' or 'r' unless you are certain, based on the rules above.\n- If the evidence window is NOT open (check 'Currently Selected Evidence' / 'Scene Description'), NEVER use 'a' to present.\n- Always loop through all Cross-Examination statements by using 'a'. After reaching the final statement, the game will automatically return to the first one. This allows you to review all statements before taking action.\n\nAvailable moves:\n* 'l': Question the witness about their statement\n* 'a': Move to the next statement OR confirm a selected option\n* 'r': Open the evidence window (press 'b' to cancel if unsure)\n* 'b': Close the evidence window or cancel a mistake\n* 'a': Present evidence (only after confirming it's correct AND window is open AND evidence is selected)\n* 'right': Navigate through the evidence items (when evidence window is open)\n* 'down': Navigate between options (when 'Available Options' are visible)\n\nBefore using 'a' to present, always ask based on CURRENT PERCEPTION:\n- \"Is 'Currently Selected Evidence' exactly the one I want to present?\"\nIf not:\n- Use 'right' to select the correct evidence.\n- DO NOT use 'a' until it's confirmed in the NEXT turn's perception.\n\nResponse Format (strict):\nmove: <move>\n\nthought: Cause: <detailed explanation>; Evidence: <current state and target, referencing PERCEPTION and MEMORY>; Effect: <expected outcome>; Reflection: <how this move relates to previous actions and maintains coherence>; Selected_Option: <the currently selected option if options are present from PERCEPTION>; Selected_Evidence: <the currently selected evidence if navigating evidence from PERCEPTION>; Presented_Evidence: <the evidence being presented when using 'a' move, confirmed from PERCEPTION>\n\nself_evaluation: <Yes / No>   # \"Yes\" if the Effect truly follows from the Cause + Evidence\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- If the evidence window is already open ('Currently Selected Evidence' is not None), do NOT use 'r' again.\n- Check 'Currently Selected Evidence' from PERCEPTION.\n- Use 'right' to navigate if it's not the correct one you intend to present based on MEMORY.\n- Only use 'a' to present when the right evidence is selected (confirm via 'Currently Selected Evidence').\n- If 'Available Options' are on screen, navigate with 'down', confirm with 'a'.\n- When in Conversation state with options, focus on choosing the best option to advance the story, NOT on evidence comparison.\n- If you see the same option again (check MEMORY), it means your previous selection was wrong. You should try a different option instead.\n- Always include the currently selected option in your thought process when 'Available Options' are present.\n- If you find yourself selecting the same evidence multiple times (check MEMORY), it likely means your previous evidence choice was wrong. Try a different piece of evidence instead.\n- Always include the 'Currently Selected Evidence' in your thought process when navigating evidence.\n- Always include the 'Presented_Evidence' in your thought process when using 'a' move to present.\n\nStuck Situation Handling (refer to MEMORY for prev_responses):\n- If no progress has been made in the last 5 responses with cross-examination game state (check prev_responses in MEMORY about whether they are the same.)\n- If the agent seems stuck in a loop or unable to advance\n- Use 'b' to break out of the loop\n- This helps the agent recover and move forward in the game"

        "prompt": " Memory Context Provided: {background}, {textual_representation}\n   Analyze the game screen image provided.\n\n\n1. Game State Detection Rules (Based ONLY on image):\n  - Cross-Examination mode is indicated by ANY of these:\n    * UI elements at the top of the screen indicating 'L Press' and 'Present R'\n    * Blue exclamation mark icons in the upper right section of the screen (health markers)\n    * Green dialog text\n * An evidence window visible in the middle of the screen\n   - If you see an evidence window, it is ALWAYS Cross-Examination mode\n  - Conversation mode is indicated by:\n  * Dialog text can be any color (most commonly white, but also blue, red, etc.)\n  - If none of the Cross-Examination indicators are present, it is Conversation mode\n  \n\n\n2. Dialog Text Analysis:\n  - Look at the bottom-left area where dialog appears\n  - Note the color of the dialog text (green/white/blue/red)\n  -Determine if the current dialog is a full sentence - Extract the speaker's name and their dialog\n  - Format must be exactly: Dialog: NAME: dialog text (or None if no dialog)\n\n\n3. Options Analysis:\n  - List any selectable choices on screen (usually white text in the middle)\n  - Indicate which one is currently selected (highlighted with yellow/gold border)\n  - Format: Options: option1, selected; option2, not selected; ... (or None)\n\n\n4. Evidence Analysis (if evidence window/record is open):\n  - Identify the name of the currently selected evidence.\n  - Describe its visual appearance.\n  - Format: Evidence: NAME: description (or None)\n\n\n5. Scene Analysis:\n - Describe if a visual indicator (down arrow) at the bottom bottom of the text box, it suggesting more text is pending for the current dialogue. - Describe any visible characters and their expressions/poses.\n  - Describe any other important visual elements or interactive UI components (like the buttons at the bottom right).\n  - Summarize key visual indicators.\n\n\n6. Reasoning and Move Decision (Based ONLY on the visual analysis above):\n  - Based on the determined Game State and the Memory Context decide the single best next action (move).\n  - Provide a brief thought process explaining your chosen move.\n  - **IMPORTANT RULE: * If a down arrow at the bottom of text box AND the current dialogue is incomplete, then Your *primary and immediate action* MUST be to advance the dialogue to see the full statement by 'a' action.
