Defense attorney Phoenix Wright, guided by his mentor Mia Fey, took the case, believing Larry\u2019s innocence and noting irregularities in the witness\u2019s account. Off camera, Phoenix and Mia confirmed through the victim\u2019s passport that she had just returned that day, and they discovered that the statue Larry gave Cindy was actually a functional clock. During the August 3, 10:00 AM trial at the District Court, prosecutor Winston Payne relied on the sole eyewitness, Frank Sahwit, whose testimony unraveled under cross-examination and revealed his true motive of burglary-turned-murder as he attempted to rob Cindy\u2019s apartment before fleeing.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Cindy's Autopsy Report\" (Document) Relevance: It establishes the victim\u2019s time of death, contradicting the witness\u2019s claimed timeline.  \n- \"Cindy's Passport\" (Document) Relevance: It proves the victim had just returned from overseas, exposing flaws in the eyewitness\u2019s version of events.  \n- \"The Thinker\" (Weapon) Relevance: Its hidden clock mechanism demonstrates the witness lied about hearing the correct time.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- Frank Sahwit, Round 1  \n  - Statement: \"I was going door-to-door selling magazines when I heard a bloodcurdling scream.\"  \n  - Present: Press  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: He could not have been innocently wandering by if he immediately entered the apartment.  \n  - Impact: Casts doubt on his reason for being at the crime scene.\n\n- Frank Sahwit, Round 2  \n  - Statement: \"I clearly heard the clock say it was 1:00 PM.\"  \n  - Present: \"Cindy's Autopsy Report\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: The victim\u2019s time of death was several hours later.  \n  - Impact: Undermines Sahwit\u2019s credibility regarding the timing of events.\n\n- Frank Sahwit, Round 3  \n  - Statement: \"I must have misheard; it actually said it was 4:00 PM.\"  \n  - Present: \"The Thinker\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Sahwit could only know the statue was a clock if he had handled it, implicating him as the killer.  \n  - Impact: Forces Sahwit\u2019s confession and clears Larry of suspicion.

Law Offices, where she had been investigating a powerful blackmailer named Redd White. Her younger sister, Maya Fey, arrived soon after and became the prime suspect when Detective Dick Gumshoe found her at the scene. On September 6, Phoenix Wright met Maya in the Detention Center and discovered she had been summoned by Mia earlier, with no evident motive to kill her. Phoenix then visited the crime scene and questioned April May at the nearby Gatewater Hotel, learning that she allegedly witnessed the murder from her room. He uncovered evidence of an illegal wiretap, suggesting that April May was spying on Mia\u2019s investigation into Redd White. On September 7, Prosecutor Winston Payne opened the trial against Maya, using April May\u2019s testimony to implicate her in the murder. However, Phoenix\u2019s off-camera inquiries revealed that Redd White had manipulated April\u2019s testimony and was behind the crime. By September 8, Phoenix confronted White in court, exposing his blackmail scheme and contradicting his statements, which ultimately proved that he orchestrated Mia\u2019s death to silence her.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Mia's Autopsy Report\" (Document) Relevance: Summarizes cause and time of death, helping challenge false timings in witness statements.  \n- \"The Thinker\" (Statue) Relevance: Identified as the murder weapon, indicating who truly wielded it.  \n- \"Wiretap\" (Device) Relevance: Shows illegal surveillance of Mia, revealing a plot beyond a simple attack.  \n- \"Maya's Cell Phone\" (Device) Relevance: Contains logged calls proving Maya went to the office by request.  \n- \"Glass Shards\" (Material) Relevance: Confirm the broken light stand, contradicting certain details in the witnesses\u2019 accounts.  \n- \"Receipt\" (Document) Relevance: Bears Mia\u2019s blood-written message pointing to the real culprit.  \n- \"Floor Plans\" (Document) Relevance: Demonstrate the sight lines from the Gatewater Hotel, undermining April May\u2019s account.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Dick Gumshoe, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \"Maya Fey was the only person in that office with the victim.\"  \n  - Present: \"Floor Plans\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Possible alternative entries challenge the sole-suspect claim.  \n  - Impact: Opens the possibility of another intruder.\n\n- **April May, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \"I clearly saw Maya use that statue to kill her sister.\"  \n  - Present: \"Wiretap\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Shows April was spying, casting doubt on her impartiality.  \n  - Impact: Weakens her credibility as a witness.\n\n- **April May, Round 2**  \n  - Statement: \"The figure I saw was unmistakably Maya Fey.\"  \n  - Present: \"Receipt\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: The blood-written note suggests the killer\u2019s identity, not Maya\u2019s.  \n  - Impact: Points to a frame-up against Maya.\n\n- **Redd White, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \"I had no dealings with Miss Mia Fey before this incident.\"  \n  - Present: \"Maya's Cell Phone\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Privileged call logs indicate White was connected to Mia\u2019s blackmail case.  \n  - Impact: Ties White to the motive for murder.\n\n- **Redd White, Round 2**  \n  - Statement: \"I only arrived in time to see the aftermath.\"  \n  - Present: \"Mia's Autopsy Report\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: The recorded time of death conflicts with White's alibi.  \n  - Impact: Proves White\u2019s direct involvement in the murder."

Law Offices (2-F, Downtown) after monitoring Mia Fey via a hidden wiretap; determined to stop her from exposing his Bluecorp black-mail ring, he struck her once on the right temple with The Thinker clock, killing her instantly and shattering the office\u2019s glass light stand before fleeing back to the Gatewater Hotel Room 303, where accomplice April May continued watch over the office windows. At 9:05 PM Maya Fey arrived in answer to Mia\u2019s urgent 8:57 call, discovered the body, and fainted; Phoenix Wright, due for a 9:00 meeting, entered around 9:10 PM, phoned police at 9:27 PM, and stayed until Detective Dick Gumshoe arrested Maya at 9:45 PM, citing a blood-smeared receipt reading \u201cMaya.\u201d Throughout 9/6 Wright\u2019s off-camera legwork netted Maya\u2019s Cellphone (with its call log), the murder weapon, floor plans, the receipt, wiretap, and a shard of the broken stand recovered from May\u2019s hotel room; he also learned that veteran attorney Marvin Grossberg had refused the case after White threatened to ruin him. Trial opened in District Court at 10:00 AM on 9/7: by dismantling Gumshoe\u2019s and May\u2019s testimonies Wright showed the Thinker\u2019s clock mechanism was empty, proved two separate phone calls occurred that night, and exposed the wiretap, shifting suspicion toward Bluecorp. Edgeworth spent the evening of 9/7 ordering a revised autopsy fixing time of death at 9:00 PM, while Wright\u2014guided by Mia\u2019s channeled spirit\u2014searched Grossberg\u2019s office on 9/8 and obtained White\u2019s confidential client list, establishing motive. In the 9/9 10:00 AM session Wright cornered Redd White: matching the stand shard to the office breakage, citing the autopsy, phone log, receipt, and wiretap, he demonstrated White had been inside the office at the moment of death.

Frank Sahwit, a door-to-door newspaper salesman and burglar, was actually present in the apartment around the time of death, having entered to commit burglary; finding Cindy dead, he took the statue (unaware it was the murder weapon) and planted Larry's name on a piece of paper. To cover his tracks and shift blame, Sahwit planned to testify that he witnessed Larry fleeing the scene around 1:00 PM. Defense attorney Mia Fey took Larry's case and assigned it to her rookie prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Phoenix Wright, for his first trial on August 3rd in District Courtroom No. 2. Before the trial, Phoenix spoke with Larry and Mia, receiving guidance and the case file.

Law Offices. Mia had recently begun investigating Redd White, the CEO of Bluecorp, uncovering his history of blackmailing influential figures using information related to the DL-6 incident. Anticipating danger, Mia called her sister Maya Fey earlier that day, instructing her to safeguard a clock shaped like \"The Thinker,\" which secretly contained a list of White's victims. Redd White confronted Mia at her office, striking and killing her with the clock to prevent his exposure. Shortly after, Maya arrived, discovered her sister's body, and called Mia's office phone, which White answered, pretending to be the police. Seeing a receipt with her name written on it (planted by White after he added the date), Maya was subsequently arrested by Detective Gumshoe. The next day, September 6th, Phoenix Wright learned of Mia's death and Maya's arrest, visited Maya at the Detention Center, and agreed to take her case. He investigated the Fey & Co. Law Offices, finding the broken \"Thinker\" clock, glass shards from a lamp, Maya's Cell Phone, and receiving Mia's Autopsy Report from Gumshoe. Phoenix then visited Grossberg Law Offices, where Marvin Grossberg initially refused help due to fear of White, but later revealed White had blackmailed him for 15 years and had likely wiretapped Mia's office, providing an affidavit. Phoenix also investigated the Gatewater Hotel, interviewing witness April May. Between the first trial day (September 7th) and the second (September 9th), Phoenix revisited the Gatewater Hotel, discovering a wiretap in April May's room, confronted her at the Detention Center learning White hired her, visited Bluecorp to meet White, and found the corresponding wiretap receiver hidden in Mia's office phone.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Attorney's Badge\" (Other) Relevance: Identifies Phoenix Wright as a defense attorney.\n- \"Mia's Autopsy Report\" (Report) Relevance: Establishes the time of death and cause of death (blunt force trauma), contradicting initial testimonies.\n- \"Maya's Cell Phone\" (Electronic) Relevance: Proves Maya called Mia's office after the murder occurred.\n- \"Glass Shards\" (Evidence) Relevance: Remnants of a lampstand near the body, linking to April May's testimony about hearing glass break.\n- \"Receipt\" (Paper) Relevance: Initially used to frame Maya, it ultimately proves Redd White saw the lamp before it broke, placing him at the scene during the crime.\n- \"\"The Thinker\" Clock\" (Weapon) Relevance: Confirmed as the murder weapon and contained Mia's crucial list of names.\n- \"April May's Testimony\" (Testimony) Relevance: Provides the initial eyewitness account, which Phoenix systematically dismantles.\n- \"Photograph\" (Photograph) Relevance: Shows April May with Redd White, establishing their connection and undermining her claims about the bellboy.\n- \"Wiretap\" (Electronic) Relevance: Proves April May's room was bugged, linking her surveillance activities to Redd White.\n- \"Grossberg's Affidavit\" (Document) Relevance: Explains Redd White's history of blackmail and establishes his motive for silencing Mia Fey.\n- \"Mia's Memo\" (Paper) Relevance: Contains the list of people Redd White blackmailed, providing the final proof of his motive and leverage to secure his confession.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Detective Gumshoe, Round 1**\n  - Statement: The report states the victim died sometime after 9:00 AM...

He found her dead, panicked, and fled the scene, leaving his fingerprints on the murder weapon he momentarily handled. His motive for fleeing was fear and panic upon discovering the body and realizing he might be blamed. The next day, Larry was arrested.

Before the trial, Mia investigated the crime scene, gathered evidence like the victim's profile, autopsy report, crime photo, and the murder weapon itself, and compiled notes for Phoenix.

        "Turnabout Sisters - (Part 1 to Part 4)": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn September 5th at 9:00 AM, Phoenix Wright met his mentor, Mia Fey, at the Fey & Co. Law Offices lobby before heading to court for his first trial. At 9:15 AM, Phoenix arrived at the district court lobby where his childhood friend Larry Butz informed him he was accused of murdering his girlfriend, Cindy Stone, earlier that day. Phoenix agreed to defend Larry against Prosecutor Winston Payne. The trial commenced at 10:00 AM, featuring witness Frank Sahwit, a salesman who claimed to have witnessed Larry committing the murder around 4:00 AM. Phoenix's cross-examination, using evidence like the \"Statue\" and \"Cindy's Autopsy Report,\" exposed contradictions in Sahwit's testimony, revealing that Sahwit himself was the killer who accidentally killed Cindy while stealing a sculpture from her apartment and lied to cover his crime, leading to Larry's acquittal. The next morning, September 6th, Phoenix visited Mia's office at 9:00 AM and found she had been murdered. Her younger sister, Maya Fey, was discovered at the scene holding a bloody statue and was arrested by Detective Dick Gumshoe under suspicion. Phoenix immediately took on Maya's defense. He investigated the crime scene at Fey & Co. Law Offices, collecting the \"Statue,\" \"Burnt Paper,\" and \"Dropped Bottle.\" He visited Maya at the Detention Center, where she gave him her \"Attorney's Badge\" and explained Mia was investigating a powerful figure. Seeking help, Phoenix visited Marvin Grossberg, a senior lawyer, at his offices, but found him evasive due to being blackmailed by Redd White, the head of Bluecorp, whom Mia was investigating. Phoenix also visited Global Studios and the Gatewater Hotel, discovering April May, who was spying on Mia from Room 507 using a \"Wiretap\" on behalf of Redd White. This investigation confirmed Redd White had a strong motive: silencing Mia, who had compiled a \"List of Crimes\" exposing his extensive blackmail and forgery operations. On September 7th at 9:00 AM, Trial Day 2 began with Miles Edgeworth as the prosecutor.
