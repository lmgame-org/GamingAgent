    "The First Turnabout": "Detailed Narrative Description:\nCharacters:\n- Phoenix Wright: Rookie defense attorney taking on his first case to defend a close friend.\n- Larry Butz: The defendant, emotionally distraught and accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend.\n- Cindy Stone: The victim, a model who had just returned from Paris.\n- Frank Sahwit: A witness whose testimony is riddled with lies and ultimately leads to his own confession.\n- Mia Fey: Phoenix’s mentor who supports his preparation and legal strategy.\n- Winston Payne: The prosecutor presenting a case built on a false witness account.\n\nConflict:\nLarry Butz is accused of murdering Cindy Stone out of jealousy. The prosecution presents what seems to be solid evidence and a direct eyewitness. Phoenix must challenge the narrative and prove that the witness is in fact the true killer.\n\nPlot:\nOn July 31, between 4 and 5 PM, Cindy Stone is murdered in her apartment with a clock-statue known as “The Thinker.” A citywide blackout disables phones and conceals the crime. Larry is arrested on August 1. Phoenix Wright, mentored by Mia Fey, investigates the case and discovers inconsistencies in the timeline and witness testimony. In court on August 3, Phoenix dismantles the prosecution’s case over multiple cross-examinations by showing the autopsy contradicts the timeline, the blackout disproves the witness’s claim of hearing the time, and the statue’s hidden clock mechanism proves the witness must have handled the weapon. Cindy’s passport reveals she had recently returned from Paris, explaining the incorrect time heard by the killer. Faced with these facts, Frank Sahwit confesses, and Larry is acquitted.\n\nSetting:\nThe murder occurs in Cindy’s downtown apartment during a prolonged power outage. The trial takes place in District Court No. 2 on August 3.\n\nTheme:\nTruth prevails when logic and integrity challenge deception. Phoenix’s determination and clever reasoning show that justice can be served even against strong odds.\n\nComplete Evidence List:\n\"Attorney's Badge\" (Other) Relevance: Verifies Phoenix’s authority as defense counsel.\n\"Cindy's Autopsy Report\" (Reports) Relevance: Fixes time of death at 4-5 PM, contradicting Sahwit’s 1 PM claim.\n\"Statue\" (Weapons) Relevance: Revealed as a talking clock, proving Sahwit handled the murder weapon.\n\"Passport\" (Evidence) Relevance: Shows victim returned from Paris on 7/30, explaining the nine-hour offset that left the clock three hours slow locally.\n\"Blackout Record\" (Documents) Relevance: Confirms power outage, so no TV could announce the time at 1 PM.\n\nCross-Examination Breakdown:\nFrank Sahwit, Round 1\nStatement: “I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.”\nPresent: “Cindy's Autopsy Report.”\nContradiction Exposed: Death occurred “between 4 PM and 5 PM,” so the body could not be found at 1 PM.\nImpact: Shatters Sahwit’s initial timeline and credibility.\n\nFrank Sahwit, Round 2\nStatement: “You see, when I found the body, I heard the time. There was a voice saying the time… It was probably coming from the television.”\nPresent: “Blackout Record.”\nContradiction Exposed: Power outage from noon-6 PM meant no television could operate.\nImpact: Forces Sahwit to alter his story, revealing deeper inconsistency.\n\nFrank Sahwit, Round 3\nStatement: “There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn’t there! Yeah, the murder weapon! The killer used it to hit the victim!”\nPresent: “Statue.”\nContradiction Exposed: Object appears as a statue; only someone who handled it would know it is a clock, contradicting Sahwit’s claim he never entered the apartment.\nImpact: Links Sahwit directly to the weapon and the scene.\n\nFrank Sahwit, Round 4\nStatement: “Let's see this evidence that proves why the clock was running slow!”\nPresent: “Passport.”\nContradiction Exposed: Victim had just flown back from Paris (nine-hour difference); clock was never reset, so it ran three hours slow locally—proof Sahwit heard it while committing the murder.\nImpact: Explains time discrepancy, delivers decisive evidence, and secures Sahwit’s confession.",
