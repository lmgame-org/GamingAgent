Future moves should prioritize consolidating high tiles in a corner (likely bottom-left) while preserving merge paths to avoid gridlock. Evaluate moves based on their ability to align tiles and increase empty spaces.",
      "The last action (\"down\") successfully consolidated tiles, reducing empty spaces from three to two, but maintained the highest tile (256) unaltered. However, the previously advantageous top-left corner strategy was disrupted, as the gaps in the top rows could jeopardize control of high-value tiles.

With limited empty spaces, inefficient tile placement could quickly lead to gridlock\u2014focus on creating merges and keeping higher tiles anchored while targeting open spaces.",
      "The move \"up\" increased empty spaces from 2 to 4, improving board flexibility while maintaining the highest tile (256) in position. However, no significant merges occurred, suggesting the move was minimally effective for progress. The key pattern is the consistent maintenance of the highest tile in a corner, aligning with the strategy. Future moves should focus on creating merge opportunities, particularly around the 256 tile, while avoiding disruptions to its placement. Consider prioritizing \"down\" or \"left\" next to consolidate lower tiles toward the main corner, optimizing for larger merges.",
      "The \"left\" action was suboptimal as it failed to create merges or improve board position, leaving only two empty spaces while slightly disrupting alignment. The highest tile (256) remains safe in a corner, but the addition of a 2 at (0,3) weakens the merging path potential. Merges were not prioritized, and the action did not capitalize on available opportunities to consolidate tiles. Future moves should focus on maximizing merges and preserving space, particularly by aligning higher tiles on one edge to maintain control and avoid corner disruption. Aim to optimize empty space usage for better tile positioning.",
      "The \"down\" move consolidated smaller tiles, creating merges (e.g., 2s to 4s), but did not impact the highest tile (256) or significantly improve positioning. Empty spaces shifted, but the same two remain, limiting opportunities. The action maintained balance but lacked strategic progression toward higher merges. The key issue is the scattered mid-tier tiles, which could restrict future merges. Focus on better clustering tiles toward one corner and maintain merge paths for the 256 tile. Prioritizing \"up\" or \"left\" next may help consolidate the board and preserve the highest tile\u2019s strategic position.",
      "After the \"down\" move, the game state remained mostly unchanged, with only the bottom-right tile increasing from 4 to 8. The action was minimally effective, as no significant merges occurred, and the two empty tiles in the top row were untouched. This suggests stagnation, with limited progress toward maximizing merges or positioning the highest tile (256) in the corner. Prioritize moves that create empty spaces near the highest tile and enable merges. Reevaluate strategy to avoid idling and ensure better tile consolidation in future actions, possibly favoring \"up\" or \"left\" next.",
      "After the \"up\" action, the board state shifted minimally, with tiles rearranging but no merges achieved. The highest tile (256) remained in place, and only two empty spaces persist. This action was ineffective for creating higher merges or opening space. Continuous reliance on \"up\" and \"down\" may trap the board in repetitive states. Future moves should focus on utilizing \"left\" or \"right\" to realign tiles and secure the highest tile in a corner, maximizing merge opportunities while preventing blockage\u2014a key strategic priority given limited empty spaces.",
      "After the last action (\"left\"), one empty space was filled, leaving only one remaining. The action failed to consolidate or advance the highest tile (256) and did not improve tile positioning for merges. Maintaining the highest tile (256) in a corner remains critical, so less impactful moves like this could compromise the board. Future strategies should prioritize clearing spaces or merging tiles to prevent gridlock. Focus on moves that preserve corner placement and create merge opportunities for higher tiles. Avoid unnecessary horizontal shifts unless they align tiles for larger merges.",
      "The last action (\"up\") filled the only empty space, leaving no room for new tiles, which significantly limits future moves. The highest tile (256) remained but was not advanced or consolidated toward the strategy of cornering high-value tiles. While the move didn't create immediate losses, it failed to address the critical need to free spaces. Moving left or down may have been more effective to maintain open tiles. Prioritize creating space and aligning mergeable tiles while protecting high-value pieces in the corner to avoid deadlocks in future moves.",
      "The move \"left\" caused minimal improvement, only merging two tiles (2s) in the bottom row, leaving the board still full with no new empty spaces. The highest tile (256) remains unchanged, indicating stagnation. The lack of progress suggests the move wasn\u2019t effective for creating merges or preserving movement flexibility. Maintain the corner strategy, but focus on moves that facilitate higher merges (e.g., consolidating mid-level tiles like 16 or 32). Be cautious of moves that only shift tiles without meaningful progression, as they could lead to a stalemate in future states."

While the jump may have been intended to interact with the brick blocks or reach the coin at (2, 1), it was ineffective due to poor execution or positioning. A clear pattern is that actions lack precision or alignment with objectives. Future moves should be planned to ensure Mario aligns with interactive objects (e.g., blocks or coins). More attention to timing and positioning is crucial for progression and optimizing opportunities in the environment.",
      "After the last action ([right, A] for 30 frames), Mario's position remained unchanged, and new brick blocks appeared where he attempted to move. The action was ineffective as progress was blocked by the new obstacle. This suggests Mario is stuck due to a collision or level design trap. The lack of immediate threats highlights a need for a strategic shift, such as breaking brick blocks or revisiting the environment for alternative pathways. A key issue is blindly advancing without addressing obstacles, calling for more deliberate exploration or vertical movement strategies in future actions.",
      "Mario jumped ([A] for 10 frames) but did not progress horizontally, remaining at the same x-coordinate (1), while moving higher vertically (y: 4 to y: 0). The action was ineffective since it did not address the obstacle (brick blocks) ahead or progress toward the goal. The prior [right, A] was more effective in breaking blocks or moving forward. A recurring issue is neglecting horizontal progress during jumps. Moving forward while jumping ([right, A]) is crucial when facing layered obstacles. For future actions, focus on combining forward movement with jumps to clear obstacles and gain momentum efficiently.",
      "The game state remained largely unchanged despite the last action ([right, A] for 20 frames), as Mario did not progress past the brick blocks at (1, 3). The action was ineffective because Mario failed to capitalize on movement or vertical positioning to potentially collect the coin at (2, 1) or clear obstacles. This reveals a pattern of inefficient jumps or lack of forward progress. Future actions should focus on refined timing and coordination of jumps to navigate obstacles, collect rewards, and avoid stagnation in gameplay. Prioritize clearing obstacles to unlock further progress.",

The action was ineffective as it didn\u2019t utilize the environment (e.g., breaking blocks or obtaining coins). A key pattern is the lack of strategic use of vertical layers and missed opportunities to clear or bypass obstacles. For future actions, consider breaking brick blocks to clear paths or adjusting movement (e.g., smaller jumps or better timing) to maintain progress and resource utilization.",
      "The game state remained largely unchanged despite the last action, indicating that Mario made no forward progress or meaningful interaction with the environment. The \"right + A\" input was ineffective, as Mario failed to navigate obstacles (brick blocks) or prepare for the gap ahead. A key issue is ineffective jump timing or movement alignment. Strategically, Mario must adjust positioning before jumping to clear gaps and avoid wasted actions. Focus on precise movement and gap-clearing readiness in future actions to mitigate risks and maintain momentum.",
      "The game state shows minimal progress; Mario's position remains unchanged in x and y coordinates, but additional brick blocks have appeared, potentially limiting movement options. The [right] action failed to meaningfully address the primary obstacle, the gap. This suggests a lack of effective utilization of Mario's jump capability (e.g., \"A\") for overcoming hazards. Future actions should prioritize combining movement with jumping to navigate gaps and avoid stalling in unnecessary areas. The unchanged obstacles signal potential inefficiency in action sequencing and a need to better align actions with immediate threats or progress opportunities.",

However, Mario's position didn't advance, indicating ineffective progression despite the correct maneuver. Brick blocks now obstruct the path, suggesting the need to plan upward or lateral movement. A missed opportunity exists to collect the coin at (2,1), highlighting poor prioritization. Future actions should optimize movement to secure collectibles while addressing obstacles. Pattern: actions seem reactive rather than strategic. Insight: Combine precise jumping with forward momentum and focus on coins or power-ups for better long-term progress.",
      "Mario successfully executed a jump with [right, A], collecting a coin at (2, 0) and avoiding the brick block obstacle at (1, 3). The action was effective, as it cleared immediate obstacles and progressed gameplay. However, Mario's position at (1, 0) suggests minimal forward movement, indicating inefficient horizontal progress. Future actions should prioritize sustained momentum (e.g., holding [right]) for better exploration and progress. Watch for increasing obstacles like stacked brick blocks at (2, 4) and (3, 4), requiring precise jumps to maintain pace while avoiding potential pitfalls.",
      "Mario\u2019s position shifted vertically to y=4, encountering new obstacles: a medium gap and a small pipe. The previous action ([right]) was ineffective as it neglected the gap, posing immediate threats. Coins were missed (x=2, y=0) earlier, signaling a lack of optimization. The new obstacles highlight the need for strategic jumping ([A]) or alternate paths to progress safely. Moving forward, balance navigation to avoid gaps and prioritize collecting reachable coins.

Keep alternating up/left to compress toward the upper edge while protecting the 256 corner, and avoid \u201cright\u201d unless you first lock larger tiles along that edge to prevent the 256 from drifting.",
      "The right move merged the two 4-tiles in row 2, creating an 8 and opening an extra space; the new 2 that spawned at (2, 1) kept the empty-cell count at six. Highest tile (256) remains anchored in the bottom-right corner, so the overall structure is still sound. Watch the pair of 2-tiles in column 1\u2014an Up swipe would combine them and re-compress the left side, while still protecting the corner stack. Keep alternating Up/Left to clear low tiles and avoid pushing the big block off its corner.",
      "The right move produced no merges\u2014tile positions shuffled slightly, empty-space count stayed at six, and the 256 remained safe in the bottom-right corner. Because score and board flexibility didn\u2019t improve, the move was essentially a wasted turn. Repeated non-merging slides risk clogging lanes and forcing an eventual left move that would dislodge the 256. Keep favoring up/down moves that consolidate columns and create merge chains along the right edge; only use left/right when a clear merge is guaranteed."

Potential moves rose from 30 to 32, so the grid is now a bit richer in options. Several near-matches cluster around rows 1-2 and columns 3-5; focus on completing those (e.g., shift col-3 pieces upward) to trigger cascades. Prioritize moves that clear the dense 3s to open the board further.",

Counts shifted only slightly, so the move gained no points and didn\u2019t open meaningful cascades. Plenty of two-in-a-row setups remain; the richest are in color-4 clusters. For a quick score, swap (2,5) 3 with (2,4) 4 to create three 4s vertically in column 5, or target other spots where a single move will turn a pair into a triple rather than making more pairs.",
      "Swapping (0,1) with (1,1) only shuffled a few candies in the upper-left but produced no 3-in-a-row; color totals barely moved and the list of 27 potential moves is unchanged. In short, the move cost a turn without scoring or creating fresh openings. Look for swaps that complete existing pairs: e.g., column 2 already has two 4\u2019s at rows 2-3\u2014bringing a third 4 down (swap (4,2)\u2194(4,3) or (3,1)\u2194(3,2)) would score immediately. Also inspect the 3/4 clusters around (5,4-6) and (6,3-5). Prioritize moves that guarantee matches rather than lateral color shifts.",
      "The row-5 swap (4 \u2194 2) shifted colours but cleared nothing, so it cost a turn without scoring. Still, it nudged the board into a looser layout: potential moves rose from 27 to 31, leaving many fresh options.  Strongest opportunity: column 2 already has two 4\u2019s stacked (rows 2-3); swapping row 1, col 1 (4) with row 1, col 2 (1) would drop a third 4 on top for a clean vertical crush.

The board is now even more 4-heavy (21 fours), but matches remain fragmentary\u2014mostly isolated pairs such as 4-3-4 in row 6 or 1-2 pairs in row 7. Look for moves that turn those pairs into triples: e.g., slide the 4 at (2,5) down or the 4 at (6,5) left to complete 4-4-4, or shift a 1 into column 4 to chain three 1\u2019s vertically.",

The board reshuffled noticeably (row 3 now 1-3-1-1-2-4\u2026), so the move was productive. Potential matches fell from 25 to 21, yet plenty remain\u2014many clustered around rows 3-5 (e.g., 3-4-5 columns) and the central 4-2 pairs. Look for swaps that extend the frequent 1/3 chains or exploit the dense 4s in columns 4-5; vertical plays there could trigger further cascades.",

Several easy setups remain: horizontal 3-pairs at (1,0-1), (2,3-4), (5,0-1) and vertical 2-pairs in columns 0, 4, 5. Prioritise swaps that extend these pairs into triples\u2014especially around columns 4-5, where stacked 2/4 and 4/2 pairs could cascade. Avoid lateral shuffles that don\u2019t touch existing pairs; aim for vertical clears to create space and new candy flow.",
      "Swapping (3,4) with (3,5) dropped a 2 into column 5, completing a vertical run of four 2\u2019s (rows 2-5). Those candies vanished and the refill shifted counts (2\u2019s \u22124, 3\u2019s +2, 1\u2019s +1).

Pattern: we\u2019re defaulting to long bursts of the same input\u2014good for open stretches but risky if an unexpected obstacle appears.
