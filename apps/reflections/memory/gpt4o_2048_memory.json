Future strategies should prioritize clearing spaces or merging tiles to prevent gridlock. Focus on moves that preserve corner placement and create merge opportunities for higher tiles. Avoid unnecessary horizontal shifts unless they align tiles for larger merges."

Prioritize creating space and aligning mergeable tiles while protecting high-value pieces in the corner to avoid deadlocks in future moves."

Maintain the corner strategy, but focus on moves that facilitate higher merges (e.g., consolidating mid-level tiles like 16 or 32). Be cautious of moves that only shift tiles without meaningful progression, as they could lead to a stalemate in future states."
