The \u201cforward jump while running\u201d pattern reliably handles ground foes and hits blocks, but it can spawn new threats off-screen. Immediate concerns: a close Koopa and a small pipe ahead. Stay on the upper blocks or time a downward stomp/kick on the Koopa, then prepare to hop the pipe cleanly."
