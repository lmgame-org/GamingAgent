        "The First Turnabout": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn 3 August 2016, between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m., model Cindy Stone was struck once in her Gatewater Apartments #201 living room with \u201cThe Thinker,\u201d a hollow statuette-clock Larry Butz had crafted as a gift; the blow crushed her skull and killed her instantly. The assailant, door-to-door news hawker Frank Sahwit, had broken in to steal Stone\u2019s Paris souvenirs, panicked when she returned from the airport, and framed her ex-boyfriend Larry by leaving the clock behind. Police arrived at 4:45 p.m., found Larry\u2019s name on the gift receipt, and\u2014guided by Sahwit\u2019s statement\u2014arrested him at 1:00 a.m. on 4 August. Phoenix Wright, Larry\u2019s boyhood friend, accepted the case under senior attorney Mia Fey. Before trial Mia secured Detective Dick Gumshoe\u2019s preliminary autopsy (T.O.D. 4:00-5:00 p.m.) and arranged to have \u201cThe Thinker\u201d submitted as evidence, but no formal field investigation phase occurs. Court convened at 10:00 a.m., 4 August 2016. Prosecutor Winston Payne first called Gumshoe, who confirmed the arrest, the 4:00-5:00 p.m. time of death, and identified the statue as the weapon yet claimed it was an ordinary ornament. Phoenix pressed but saved the contradiction for the next witness. Payne then produced star witness Sahwit, who swore he saw Larry flee the apartment at \u201caround 1:00 p.m.\u201d Phoenix impeached him with the autopsy time window, forcing a revised testimony that Sahwit had learned the correct time because \u201cthe statue rang out.\u201d Phoenix exposed the hidden clock mechanism by having the bailiff trigger \u201cThe Thinker\u201d in court, proving Sahwit could not have recognized the sound from outside. Finally, when the clock read 8:25 while the courtroom clock showed 11:25, Phoenix linked the three-hour discrepancy to Stone\u2019s recent Paris trip, demonstrating the clock was slow on 3 August and therefore silent. Knowing the only way to identify it as a clock was to handle it inside the apartment, Sahwit broke down and confessed. Judge rendered a not-guilty verdict for Larry at 2:16 p.m., 4 August 2016.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \u201cCindy\u2019s Autopsy Report\u201d (Document) Relevance: Fixes time of death at 4:00\u20135:00 p.m., contradicting Sahwit\u2019s initial 1:00 p.m. claim and proving his story false.  \n- \u201cThe Thinker\u201d (Murder Weapon/Clock) Relevance: Demonstrating its hidden clock function and the three-hour time lag shows only the killer could know it was a clock, directly implicating Sahwit.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Detective Dick Gumshoe, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \u201cThe weapon was this statue\u2014just a plain, heavy ornament.\u201d\n  - Present: Press\n  - Contradiction Exposed: None yet; pressing establishes the item\u2019s chain of custody and that police never noted any clock function.\n  - Impact: Sets up later revelation that the \u2018ornament\u2019 is actually a clock, undermining police thoroughness.\n\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \u201cI saw the defendant leave the apartment at about 1:00 p.m.\u201d\n  - Present: \u201cCindy\u2019s Autopsy Report\u201d\n  - Contradiction Exposed: Autopsy fixes death at 4:00-5:00 p.m., making 1:00 p.m. impossible.\n  - Impact: Forces Sahwit to change testimony, damaging credibility and opening path to clock revelation.\n\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 2**\n  - Statement: \u201cI knew it was 4:00 because the statue rang\u2014\u2018I think it\u2019s 4 o\u2019clock!\u2019\u2014from inside.\u201d\n  - Present: \u201cThe Thinker\u201d\n  - Contradiction Exposed: Only someone close enough to handle the statuette could know it was a talking clock; police didn\u2019t.\n  - Impact: Shows insider knowledge, hinting Sahwit was in the apartment.\n\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 3**\n  - Statement: \u201cThe clock rang loudly; anyone outside could hear it.\u201d\n  - Present: \u201cThe Thinker\u201d (judge tests it)\n  - Contradiction Exposed: Clock currently reads 8:25, proving it is three hours slow and silent at 4:00 p.m.; thus Sahwit could not have heard it.\n  - Impact: Definitively exposes false testimony, triggers confession, and secures Larry\u2019s acquittal.",
        "Turnabout Sisters - (Part 1 to Part 4)": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn September 5, 2016 at 9:00 PM, Bluecorp president Redd White, desperate to silence defense attorney Mia Fey\u2019s blackmail files on his corporate extortion ring, entered the Fey & Co. Law Offices and struck Mia once on the right temple with \u201cThe Thinker\u201d clock-statue, fatally wounding her. In the few minutes before death (9:00-9:05 PM), Mia used her own blood to write \u201cMaya\u201d on a department-store receipt for a glass light stand, intending to summon her sister for help. White confiscated the incriminating DL-6 blackmail material, set up a wiretap on Mia\u2019s phone to hide his real purpose, and fled, accidentally shattering the light stand near the window on his way out. At 9:05 PM Phoenix Wright phoned Mia; Maya, who had hurried over after a 8:57 PM call from Mia, answered in panic and became the sole person at the scene when police arrived, leading Detective Dick Gumshoe to arrest her at 9:30 PM for murder.  \u2022  September 6: Phoenix officially takes Maya\u2019s case, gathers Mia\u2019s autopsy report (death \u201cinstantaneous\u201d), collects Maya\u2019s cell phone with the 9:05 PM call record, and notices the broken light-stand shards and \u201cThe Thinker\u201d weapon. He tracks the wiretap to Gatewater Hotel Room 303, meeting flirtatious occupant April May.  \u2022  September 7\u2014Trial Day 1: Gumshoe testifies that the bloody \u201cMaya\u201d receipt proves motive; Phoenix counters with the autopsy report showing Mia supposedly died instantly, so could not have written anything, forcing a recess in which Prosecutor Edgeworth produces a revised autopsy (\u201cdied within minutes\u201d). April May then claims she saw Maya strike Mia precisely at 9:00 PM from her hotel window; Phoenix exposes her illegal wiretap, undermining her credibility and earning an overnight extension.  \u2022  September 8: Phoenix learns from retired attorney Marvin Grossberg that White has been blackmailing prominent figures with DL-6 secrets; he infiltrates Bluecorp, confronts White, and secures the Glass Light Stand Receipt proving a stand once blocked the office window\u2014information only an intruder inside the room could know.  \u2022  September 9\u2014Trial Day 2: Phoenix calls Redd White as a defense witness; White claims he witnessed the murder from Bluecorp\u2019s 15th-floor office across the street. During cross-examination Phoenix uses the glass-stand receipt to prove the stand\u2019s existence was invisible from outside, meaning White had been inside the office and is the real killer. Faced with this and the exposed blackmail motive, Edgeworth concedes, the court finds Maya Fey not guilty, and Phoenix inherits Mia\u2019s firm while Maya vows to train as a spirit medium and legal assistant.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Mia's Autopsy Report\" (Report) Relevance: Timelines of death (\u201cinstant\u201d then \u201cwithin minutes\u201d) let Phoenix dispute the prosecution\u2019s dying-message theory.  \n- \"The Thinker\" (Clock-Statue / Murder Weapon) Relevance: Being both weapon and hidden clock helps Phoenix test whether witnesses could identify it without handling it, catching April May and Redd White in lies.  \n- \"Glass Light Stand Receipt\" (Receipt) Relevance: Proves a tall stand existed just inside the window, so White could only know of it by being in the office, not observing from across the street.  \n- \"Maya's Cell Phone\" (Electronic) Relevance: The 9:05 PM recorded call contradicts April May\u2019s exact-9:00 PM timeline and shows Mia was alive after the supposed instant death.  \n- \"Wiretap\" (Device) Relevance: Establishes April May and White\u2019s eavesdropping motive, destroying the prosecution\u2019s portrayal of May as an innocent eyewitness.  \n- \"DL-6 Incident Photo & File\" (Photograph/Document) Relevance: Demonstrates Redd White\u2019s long-running blackmail scheme, giving him motive to silence Mia.  \n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Detective Dick Gumshoe, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \u201cThe victim wrote the name \u2018Maya\u2019 as she died; the autopsy shows she was killed instantly.\u201d  \n  - Present: \"Mia's Autopsy Report\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: An instantaneous death leaves no time to write a message.  \n  - Impact: Casts doubt on the prosecution\u2019s central piece of incriminating evidence, prompting the autopsy revision.\n\n- **April May, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \u201cAt exactly 9:00 PM I saw the defendant hit the victim with a statue from my hotel window.\u201d  \n  - Present: \"Maya's Cell Phone\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Phone record proves Mia was alive at 9:05 PM, so May\u2019s timing is false.  \n  - Impact: Undermines her credibility and leads the court to question why she was really watching the office.\n\n- **April May, Round 2**  \n  - Statement: \u201cI was just a curious bystander; I had no other interest in that office.\u201d  \n  - Present: \"Wiretap\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: The recovered tap shows she was illegally monitoring Mia\u2019s calls.  \n  - Impact: Establishes motive to spy and suggests collaboration with the real killer, earning a trial extension.\n\n- **Redd White, Round 1**  \n  - Statement: \u201cFrom my 15th-floor office I clearly saw the defendant strike the fatal blow.\u201d  \n  - Present: \"Glass Light Stand Receipt\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: Only someone inside the office could know a glass stand (not visible from outside) was present and broken.  \n  - Impact: Proves White was at the crime scene, flipping him from witness to prime suspect.\n\n- **Redd White, Round 2**  \n  - Statement: \u201cI had no reason to harm Ms. Fey; we were but business acquaintances.\u201d  \n  - Present: \"DL-6 Incident Photo & File\"  \n  - Contradiction Exposed: File shows Mia was gathering evidence of White\u2019s blackmail operation, giving him clear motive.  \n  - Impact: Establishes intent, leading Edgeworth to withdraw the charges against Maya and the court to declare her innocent."

        "The First Turnabout": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn July 31st, between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM, model Cindy Stone was murdered in her apartment via blunt force trauma to the head. Her estranged boyfriend, Larry Butz, discovered the body shortly after 5:00 PM and was arrested as the prime suspect. Phoenix Wright, a rookie defense attorney and Larry's childhood friend, took the case under the guidance of his mentor, Mia Fey. Mia provided Phoenix with Cindy's Autopsy Report before the trial. The trial commenced on August 3rd at 10:00 AM. Prosecutor Winston Payne presented Frank Sahwit, a newspaper salesman, as the key eyewitness. Sahwit testified he saw Larry flee the scene around 1:00 PM after hearing a loud thud and discovering the body through the apartment window. During cross-examination, Phoenix pressed Sahwit on the time, eventually presenting the Statue (a clock shaped like \"The Thinker\") which Sahwit claimed announced the time as 1:00 PM. Phoenix revealed the clock was three hours slow due to Cindy recently returning from a trip (evidenced by her Passport) and couldn't have announced the time correctly, exposing Sahwit's lie about hearing it. Phoenix then presented Cindy's Autopsy Report, confirming the death occurred between 4:00 PM and 5:00 PM, further contradicting Sahwit's timeline. Cornered, Sahwit confessed he was burglarizing the apartment, struck Cindy with the clock statue when she surprised him, and then framed Larry. Larry Butz was declared not guilty.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Attorney's Badge\" (Court Record) Relevance: Identifies Phoenix Wright as an attorney but holds no direct evidentiary value in this case.\n- \"Cindy's Autopsy Report\" (Court Record) Relevance: Establishes the victim's time of death between 4 PM and 5 PM, directly contradicting Sahwit's initial testimony about discovering the body at 1 PM.\n- \"Statue\" (Court Record) Relevance: Revealed to be the actual murder weapon and a clock, its time discrepancy and sound mechanism were crucial in breaking Sahwit's testimony.\n- \"Passport\" (Court Record) Relevance: Proves the victim was recently abroad, explaining why the clock statue was three hours slow due to timezone differences.\n- \"Woman's Photo\" (Court Record) Relevance: Belongs to Larry Butz, showing Cindy Stone; initially considered motive evidence by the prosecution but ultimately irrelevant to the crime's resolution.\n- \"Mia's Memo\" (Court Record) Relevance: Contains the combination \"Maya\" written on the back of the autopsy report receipt, significant for future cases but unused evidentially here.\n- \"Blackout Record\" (Court Record) Relevance: Initially presented by Payne to suggest the victim couldn't have watched TV due to a blackout, used by Phoenix to argue the clock wasn't reset post-blackout, supporting the time difference theory (though the passport later became the primary proof).\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"I remember the time exactly... It was 1 PM.\" (Regarding discovering the body)\n  - Present: \"Statue\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The witness claimed he heard the time from the clock, but the clock itself (the statue) was three hours slow.\n  - Impact: Shatters the witness's claimed timeline and establishes he lied about hearing the time announced.\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 2**\n  - Statement: \"I heard the time... from the television, yes.\" (After being contradicted about the clock announcement)\n  - Present: \"Cindy's Autopsy Report\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The autopsy report states the death occurred between 4 PM and 5 PM, making Sahwit's 1 PM discovery impossible.\n  - Impact: Proves the witness could not have discovered the body at the time he claimed, regardless of the source of the time.\n- **Frank Sahwit, Round 3**\n  - Statement: \"I saw it! He... the defendant... he hit her! He hit her with that... that clock!\" (Changing story to claim witnessing the act)\n  - Present: \"Statue\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The witness claimed he heard the clock announce the time, but the clock statue makes no sound when announcing time; it was the *weapon*, not a time source he could have heard.\n  - Impact: Forces the final confession by exposing the impossibility of his claim and directly implicating him via knowledge of the weapon.",
        "Turnabout Sisters - (Part 1 to Part 4)": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn the evening of September 5th, around 9:00 PM, Mia Fey was murdered in her office at Fey & Co. Law Offices via blunt force trauma inflicted by \"The Thinker\" clock statue. Her sister, Maya Fey, discovered the body shortly after, finding a receipt nearby with \"April May\" written on it by Mia. Phoenix Wright arrived later, finding Maya distraught beside the body just as police, led by Detective Gumshoe, entered and arrested Maya based on the circumstances and the note. The next day, September 6th, Phoenix agreed to defend Maya. His investigation led him to the Gatewater Hotel, where he interviewed witness April May who claimed to have seen Maya commit the crime from her hotel room window, and the Fey & Co. Law Offices where he recovered Maya's dropped cell phone, glass shards from a broken lamp stand, and confirmed \"The Thinker\" as the murder weapon. He also visited Marvin Grossberg, Mia's former mentor, learning Mia had been investigating Bluecorp CEO Redd White in connection with the historical DL-6 incident, and obtained Mia Fey's Autopsy Report from Gumshoe. In court on September 7th, prosecutor Miles Edgeworth first called Gumshoe to establish the crime details. April May then testified she saw Maya push Mia onto a lamp stand; Phoenix countered by presenting \"The Thinker\" as the actual weapon and the Glass Shards to prove the lamp stand was already broken *before* the murder (having been purchased the day prior, evidenced by the receipt date), forcing April to admit she lied about witnessing the act and revealing she had placed a wiretap inside \"The Thinker\" for Redd White. On September 8th, Phoenix revisited the Gatewater Hotel, obtaining the Bellboy's Affidavit confirming April May checked in on September 4th with a man (Redd White) and asked for a screwdriver, indicating premeditation for planting the bug. At Bluecorp, Phoenix confronted White, who feigned ignorance. Finally, Phoenix confronted Grossberg again, learning White had blackmailed Grossberg for 15 years regarding DL-6 information, forcing Grossberg to feed White information on Mia's investigation; Grossberg provided a Photograph proving White's blackmail activities. In court on September 9th, the Bellboy testified, corroborating April's setup. Redd White then took the stand, claiming he arrived after the murder, found the body, called police, and saw Maya flee. Phoenix exposed White's knowledge of the broken lamp (information only someone present before police could know), used Maya's Cell Phone records to show April overheard Maya *after* the murder (contradicting White's timeline of Maya fleeing immediately), presented Mia's Memo (the receipt) to show Mia knew about April May (implying Mia knew of White's scheme), and finally presented the Photograph, revealing White's motive: silencing Mia's investigation into his blackmailing. Cornered, Redd White confessed to the murder.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- Attorney's Badge (Profiles) Relevance: Identifies Phoenix Wright as an attorney (standard item, not used for contradiction).\n- Mia's Memo (Documents) Relevance: Proves Mia knew the name \"April May\" before her death, linking April May and indirectly Redd White to the victim's awareness.\n- Autopsy Report (Reports) Relevance: Establishes the time of death and confirms the cause was blunt force trauma from \"The Thinker,\" contradicting initial testimony about the weapon.\n- Maya's Cell Phone (Other) Relevance: Proves Maya was still in the office talking on the phone *after* Mia was killed, contradicting Redd White's testimony about when she fled.\n- Glass Shards (Evidence) Relevance: Demonstrates the lamp stand was broken *before* the murder occurred, proving April May lied about seeing Maya push Mia onto it.\n- \"The Thinker\" Clock (Evidence) Relevance: Confirms the actual murder weapon and held the wiretap placed by April May, directly linking her and Redd White's scheme to the crime scene.\n- April May's Testimony (Documents) Relevance: Records April May's false claim of witnessing Maya attack Mia with the lamp stand.\n- Bellboy's Affidavit (Documents) Relevance: Corroborates April May's suspicious actions at the hotel (checking in with White, needing a screwdriver), suggesting premeditation for the wiretap.\n- Photograph (Evidence) Relevance: Exposes Redd White's history of blackmail and provides his motive for murdering Mia Fey, who was investigating him.\n- Wiretap (Evidence) Relevance: Confirms April May bugged Mia's office, revealing her direct involvement and connection to Redd White's plan.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **April May, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"The victim... She was killed by that glass clock stand thingy!\" (Paraphrased: claimed the lamp stand was the murder weapon)\n  - Present: \"The Thinker\" Clock\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The autopsy report and the statue itself prove \"The Thinker\" was the murder weapon, not the lamp stand.\n  - Impact: Forces April May to admit she lied about a fundamental detail of the crime, undermining her credibility.\n- **April May, Round 2**\n  - Statement: \"Then I saw her! The girl with the funny clothes! She... She hit the victim!\" (Paraphrased: claimed she saw Maya push Mia, causing the lamp stand to fall and kill her)\n  - Present: Glass Shards\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The lamp stand was already broken before the murder (proven by the shards and the purchase date on Mia's Memo), so she couldn't have seen Maya push an intact stand onto Mia.\n  - Impact: Proves April May fabricated witnessing the crime itself, leading to her confession about the wiretap.\n- **Redd White, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"The glass light stand was lying on the floor.

I had no reason!\" (Claiming he lacked any motive to murder Mia Fey)\n  - Present: Photograph\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The photograph proves White engaged in blackmail, which Mia was investigating, thus providing a strong motive for him to silence her permanently.\n  - Impact: Reveals White's clear motive for murder, destroying his defense and leading directly to his confession."

In court, Sahwit testified as a witness, claiming to be a newspaper salesman who saw a man fleeing the scene and heard the clock announce 1:00 PM when he entered the apartment to check on the victim. Phoenix demonstrated that the clock was actually running three hours slow, meaning it would have announced 10:00 AM, not 1:00 PM at the time of the murder. This proved Sahwit could not have heard what he claimed.

Phoenix took Maya's case and investigated the Gatewater Hotel across from the office, where witness April May was staying. He discovered April had tapped Mia's phone under orders from her employer, Redd White of Bluecorp. The next day, Phoenix visited Bluecorp headquarters, confronting White and realizing he was the killer, though lacking proof. In court on September 7, Prosecutor Miles Edgeworth called April May, who claimed to witness Maya attacking Mia. Phoenix proved she couldn't see people inside the office and exposed her wiretapping. When Phoenix accused White, White used his influence to become a witness on September 8. During White's testimony, Phoenix gradually exposed contradictions, finally proving White's presence with a receipt hidden in The Thinker clock and establishing his motive - Mia had been collecting evidence of White's blackmail business, including his role in the suicide of Misty Fey, Maya and Mia's mother.

        "The First Turnabout": "1) Detailed Narrative Description:\nOn December 5 at approximately 3:00 PM, Will Powers, president of the Technological Era High School Drama Club, was found fatally stabbed in the bicycle shed behind the school. Officer Morris arrived minutes later and arrested Larry Butz, claiming he discovered Larry clutching a bloody kitchen knife. Phoenix Wright\u2019s off-screen investigation included reviewing the official Police Report at the sheriff\u2019s office, inspecting the shed\u2019s lock mechanism, obtaining security camera logs from school maintenance, and interviewing the drama club janitor about costume components. The trial opened on December 8 at 9:30 AM with Prosecutor Winston Payne calling Officer Morris to testify about the time of discovery and the identification of the weapon. Phoenix countered by presenting the Police Report to show the time was based on a broken clock and introduced the Bloody Knife to demonstrate the blade\u2019s unique size matched Powers\u2019s prop knife rather than Larry\u2019s. During Larry\u2019s testimony, he claimed he dropped the knife and left at 2:30 PM; Phoenix pressed with the Police Report to reveal the shed\u2019s lock was intact until after Powers\u2019s death, proving Larry could not have exited before the stabbing. With those contradictions exposed, Phoenix concluded Powers accidentally stabbed himself during a rehearsal, securing Larry\u2019s acquittal.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Police Report\" (Court Record) Relevance: Reveals the shed\u2019s clock was broken and the time of death was only an estimate, undermining the prosecution\u2019s timeline.\n- \"Bloody Knife\" (Hard Evidence) Relevance: Matches the dimensions and design of Will Powers\u2019s drama prop, contradicting the claim that it belonged to Larry Butz.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- Officer Morris, Round 1\n  - Statement: \"I found Larry holding the knife at 3:03 PM.\"\n  - Present: \"Police Report\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The shed\u2019s clock was stopped, so the stated time is unreliable.\n  - Impact: Undermines the officer\u2019s claim of precise timing and weakens the prosecution\u2019s timeline.\n\n- Officer Morris, Round 2\n  - Statement: \"That knife belonged to Larry Butz.\"\n  - Present: \"Bloody Knife\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The blade matches Will Powers\u2019s prop knife, not Larry\u2019s personal property.\n  - Impact: Sows doubt about the officer\u2019s identification of the murder weapon.\n\n- Larry Butz, Round 1\n  - Statement: \"I left the shed at 2:30 PM after dropping the knife.\"\n  - Present: Press\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The shed\u2019s lock was intact until after Powers\u2019s death, so Larry could not have exited at that time.\n  - Impact: Demonstrates Larry\u2019s alibi was impossible and shifts suspicion away from him.",

Phoenix Wright arrived at the scene shortly thereafter, confiscated the blood-stained letter opener as the presumed murder weapon, obtained Maya\u2019s office key and her Power of Attorney, and reviewed the autopsy report indicating a single stab wound and time of death at 5:00 PM. Off-screen, Phoenix inspected the floor for abnormal footprints, photographed muddy tracks leading to a rear window, examined a missing vent grate at police headquarters, and cross-referenced the security guard shift log. In court, Maya testified she had been at the temple until 5:05 PM and found Mia\u2019s corpse; Officer Gumshoe asserted the locked office left no point of entry; and security guard Mike Meekins maintained the vent grate was never removed. Phoenix countered Gumshoe\u2019s claim by presenting the muddy-footprint photograph and the shift log to expose an intruder, then introduced the removed vent grate to prove an escape route, ultimately securing Maya\u2019s acquittal.\n\n2) Complete Evidence List:\n- \"Letter Opener\" (Murder Weapon) Relevance: Contains Mia\u2019s blood and matches the fatal wound\u2019s profile, ruling out other weapons.\n- \"Office Key\" (Key Item) Relevance: Demonstrates Maya\u2019s sole access to the locked office at the time of death.\n- \"Power of Attorney\" (Document) Relevance: Establishes Phoenix\u2019s legal authority to represent Maya and access her belongings.\n- \"Autopsy Report\" (Document) Relevance: Confirms time of death at 5:00 PM, conflicting with Maya\u2019s return timeline.\n- \"Security Guard Shift Log\" (Document) Relevance: Reveals gaps in Gumshoe\u2019s testimony about guard patrols and witness availability.\n- \"Photograph of Muddy Footprints\" (Photograph) Relevance: Undermines the prosecution\u2019s assertion of no entry or exit points.\n- \"Vent Grate\" (Exhibit) Relevance: Matches the missing grate in Mia\u2019s office, proving the killer\u2019s escape route.\n\n3) Cross-Examination Breakdown:\n- **Maya Fey, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"I handed Phoenix my office key this morning before going to the temple.\"\n  - Present: \"Office Key\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: Key\u2019s unique scratches indicate Maya retained it all day, not giving it to Phoenix.\n  - Impact: Undermines Maya\u2019s alibi and suggests she still had access to the crime scene.\n\n- **Detective Gumshoe, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"No one could have entered through the window; the office rug was undisturbed.\"\n  - Present: \"Photograph of Muddy Footprints\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: Photo clearly shows muddy footprints leading to and from the window.\n  - Impact: Introduces the possibility of a third-party intruder, weakening the prosecution\u2019s case.\n\n- **Mike Meekins, Round 1**\n  - Statement: \"That vent grate has always been in place; it wasn\u2019t removed.\"\n  - Present: \"Vent Grate\"\n  - Contradiction Exposed: The grate in evidence exactly matches the missing panel from Mia\u2019s office floor.\n  - Impact: Proves an alternative escape route for the true murderer, exonerating Maya."
