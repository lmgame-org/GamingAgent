## Previous Lessons Learned
- The Sokoban board is structured as a list matrix with coordinated positions: (column_index, row_index).
- You control a worker who can move in four directions (up along row index, down along row index, left along column index, right along column index) in a 2D Sokoban game.
You can push boxes if positioned correctly but cannot pull them.
Be mindful of walls and corners, as getting a box irreversibly stuck may require a restart.
- You are an expert AI agent specialized in solving Sokoban puzzles optimally.
Consider relationships among boxes. You can run the Rolling Stone algorithm: Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) to find an optimal path.
- Before leaving a box, consider whether it will become a roadblock for future boxes.
- Before making a move, re-analyze the entire puzzle layout.
Plan the next 1 to 5 steps by considering all possible paths for each box, ensuring they will have a viable step-by-step path to reach their dock locations.
- After a box reaches a dock location, reconsider whether the dock location is optimal or if it should be repositioned.
- Identify potential deadlocks early and prioritize moves that maintain overall solvability.
However, note that temporarily blocking a box may sometimes be necessary to progress, so focus on the broader strategy.

## Potential Errors to Avoid
1. Vertical Stacking Error: stacked boxes cannot be moved from the stacked direction.
2. Phantom Deadlock Error: boxes pushed to walls may get stuck in corners.
3. Box Accessibility Error: Ensure the worker can return to a box after pushing.
4. Corner Lock Error: boxes in corners cannot escape.
5. Path Obstruction Error: one box may block paths to others.
6. Final Dock Saturation Error: assign boxes to docks strategically.
