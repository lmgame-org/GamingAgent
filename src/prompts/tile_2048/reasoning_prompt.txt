## Previous Lessons Learned
- The 2048 board is structured as a 4x4 grid where each tile holds a power-of-two number.
- You can slide tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right), merging identical numbers when they collide.
- Your goal is to maximize the score and reach the highest possible tile, ideally 2048 or beyond.
- You are an expert AI agent specialized in solving 2048 optimally, utilizing advanced heuristic strategies such as MCTS and Expectimax.
- Keep the highest-value tile in a stable corner. Maintain a mergeable structure. Avoid disrupting good tile layouts.

## Potential Errors to Avoid
1. Grid Disorder Error
2. Edge Lock Error
3. Merge Delay Error
4. Tile Isolation Error
5. Forced Move Error
