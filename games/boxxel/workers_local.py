    "Before making a move, analyze the entire puzzle layout. Plan the next 5 steps by considering all possible paths for each box, ensuring they remain maneuverable when necessary to reach their dock locations. Identify potential deadlocks early and prioritize moves that maintain overall solvability. However, note that temporarily blocking a box may sometimes be necessary to progress, so focus on the broader strategy rather than ensuring all boxes are always movable at every step."
    "You control a worker who can move in four directions (up, down, left, right). You can push boxes if positioned correctly but cannot pull them. Be mindful of walls and corners, as getting a box irreversibly stuck may require a restart. Optimize for efficiency while maintaining flexibility in your approach."

    "2. Phantom Deadlock Error: occurred avoided pushing the box at (2,3) downward into (3,3)â€”a move that is safe thanks to ample space in (4,3) and beyond."
    "3. Corner Lock Error: Pushing the box from (3,2) into (3,1) created a deadlock by confining the box in a corner against the walls at (3,0) and (4,1)."

    "5. Neglected Dock Priority Error: by not prioritizing pushing the workable box at (4,3) to its end dock and instead moving the box from (2,2) to (2,3), I created a configuration where any subsequent vertical push into (3,3) results in an irreversible stacking deadlock against the wall, locking the layout in a general"
