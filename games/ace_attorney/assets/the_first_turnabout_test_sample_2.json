            "Sahwit: I was going door-to-door, selling subscriptions when I saw a man fleeing an apartment.",
            "SAHWIT: I thought he must be in a hurry because he left the door half-open behind him.",
            "Sahwit: Thinking it strange, I looked inside the apartment.",
            "Sahwit: Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!",
            "Sahwit: I quailed in fright and found myself unable to go inside.",
            "Sahwit: I thought to call the police immediately!",
            "Sahwit: However, the phone in her apartment wasn't working.",
            "Sahwit: I went to a nearby park and found a public phone.",
            "Sahwit: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",
            "SAHWIT: I remember the time exactly: It was 1:00 PM.",

            "Phoenix: I present the Cindy’s Autopsy Report.",
            "Phoenix: You found the body at 1:00 PM. You’re sure.",
            "Sahwit: Yes. It was 1:00 PM, for certain.",
            "Phoenix: Frankly, I find that hard to believe!",
            "Phoenix: Your statement directly contradicts the autopsy report.",
            "Phoenix: The autopsy notes the time of death at sometime after 4PM.",
            "Phoenix: There was nobody to… er… no \"body\" to find at 1:00 PM!",
            "Phoenix: How do you explain this three-hour gap?",
            "Sahwit: !!!",
            "Sahwit: Oh, that! Oh, er...",
            "Payne: This is trivial! The witness merely forgot the time!",
            "Judge: After his testimony, I find that hard to believe.",
            "Judge: Mr. Sahwit...",
            "Judge: Why were you so certain that you found the body at 1:00 PM?",
            "Sahwit: I... er... well, I... Gee, that's a really good question!",
            "Mia: Great job, Wright! Way to put him on the spot!",
            "Mia: That’s all you have to do: point out contradictions!",
            "Mia: Lies always beget more lies!",
            "Mia: See through one, and their whole story falls apart!",
            "Sahwit: Wait! I remember now!",
            "Judge: Would you care to give your testimony again?",
            "Options: Evidence:",
            "Sahwit: You see, when I found the body, I heard the time.",
            "Sahwit: There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television.",
            "Sahwit: Oh, but it was three hours off, wasn't it?",
            "Sahwit: I guess the victim must have been watching a video of a taped program!",
            "Sahwit: That’s why I thought it was 1:00 PM!",
            "Sahwit: Terribly sorry about the misunderstanding...",
            "Judge: Hmm... I see.",
            "Judge: Mr. Wright, you may cross-examine the witness.",

            "Phoenix: Hold it right there!",
            "Phoenix: The prosecution has said there was a blackout at the time of the discovery!",
            "Phoenix: And this record proves it!",
            "Sahwit: ...!",
            "Phoenix: You couldn't have heard a television... or a video!",
            "Sahwit: Gah!!!",

            "Sahwit: M-my apologies, Your Honor!",
            "Sahwit: It... er, it must have been the shock of finding the body!",
            "Judge: Very well, Mr. Sahwit.",

            "Phoenix: A \"table clock\"? Was there a clock at the scene?",

            "Sahwit: Actually, I didn’t “hear” the time… I “saw” it!",
            "Phoenix: The... murder weapon?",
            "Sahwit: Yes, the table clock that was used as a weapon!",
            "Sahwit: That's what I just said. Did you doze off in the middle of my testimony or something?",
            "Phoenix: (Something's fishy here…)",
            "Sahwit: Actually, I didn’t \"hear\" the time... I \"saw\" it!",
            "Phoenix: That strikes me as a very suspicious mistake.",
            "Sahwit: Yes, I can see how you’d be a little doubtful...",
            "Sahwit: I’m really sorry. I only just remembered that table clock!",
            "Judge: A \"table clock\"?",
            "SAHWIT: There was a table clock in the apartment, wasn't there!",
            "Phoenix: I present the Statue.",
            "Phoenix: Wait just a moment!",
            "Phoenix: The murder weapon wasn't a clock. It was this statue!",
            "Phoenix: Now how is this supposed to be a clock?",
            "Sahwit: Y-you with your \"objections,\" and your \"evidence\"... Just who do you think you are",
            "Phoenix: Just answer the question, Mr. Sahwit.",

            "PAYNE: Your Honor! If I may...",
            "Judge: Yes, Mr. Payne?",
            "Payne: As the witness stated, this statue is indeed a clock.",
            "Payne: The neck is a switch. You just tilt it, and it says the time out loud.",
            "Payne: As it doesn't look like a clock, I submitted it as a statue. My apologies.",
            "Judge: I see.",
            "Judge: So the murder weapon was a table clock after all.",
            "Judge: Well, Mr. Wright?",
            "Judge: It appears that the witness's testimony was correct. This is a clock.",
            "Judge: It appears that the witness’s testimony was correct. This is a clock.",
            "Judge: Do you have any problems with his testimony now?",
            "Phoenix: I guess not.",
            "Phoenix: There was a clock on the scene, so, no problem.",
            "Mia: Wright! Are you out of your mind!?",
            "Mia: That clock doesn't look like a clock at all!",
            "Mia: The witness couldn't have possibly known it was a clock just by seeing it!",
            "Mia: He said himself, he never entered the apartment!",
            "Mia: It was in his testimony!",
            "Phoenix: Hey! You’re right!",
            "Judge: Is something the matter? Does the defense have anything to add?",
            "Phoenix: Yes... Yes I do!",
            "Phoenix: The only way he could have known the weapon was a clock is to hold it in his hand.",
            "Phoenix: Yet the witness testified that he never entered the apartment!",
            "Phoenix: Clearly, a contradiction!",
            "Judge: Hmm... indeed!",
            "Phoenix: The witness knew it was a clock, because he...",
            "Phoenix: You’re lying!",
            "Phoenix: You were inside the apartment on the day of the murder!",
            "Sahwit: Oh yeah? Prove it! Prove I went in there!",
            "Phoenix: I’ll do better than that! I can prove you were the one who killed her!",
            "Phoenix: You struck her with the clock, and the shock of the blow triggered the clock’s voice!",
            "Phoenix: That was the sound you heard!",
            "Judge: Order in the court!",
            "Judge: Intriguing. Please continue, Mr. Wright.",

            "Payne: W-w-what’s the meaning of this?",
            "Payne: This is all baseless conjecture!",
            "Phoenix: Baseless...?",
            "Phoenix: Just look at the witness’s face!",
            "Sahwit: Ngh... grrrah!",
            "Judge: Would the witness care to elaborate?",
            "Judge: Did you strike the victim with the clock?",

            "Payne: Your Honor, a-a moment please!",
            "Payne: There isn't a shred of evidence supporting the defense's claims!",

            "ATTORNEY'S BADGE: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.. UI description: A round, coin-sized metal token with a bright, polished gold finish. The outer edge flares into a series of evenly spaced, petal-like ridges, giving it a sunburst or flowerburst appearance. In the center, a raised circular disk bears a small, stylized emblem embossed into the metal. The surface is smooth and unmarred—no scratches, dents, or inscriptions—while subtle shading around the ridges and central disk conveys a slightly convex, three-dimensional form. The back isn’t shown, but the flatness of the piece suggests it clips or pins onto fabric.",
            "CINDY'S AUTOPSY REPORT: Time of death: 7/31, 4PM - 5PM. Cause of death: loss of blood due to blunt trauma.. UI description: A rectangular, buff-colored envelope made of sturdy paper stock, its pointed flap folded over the body. Two small, silver-toned metal button clasps—one on the flap, one on the main body—are connected by a thin beige cord looped in a figure-eight to keep it sealed. The surface shows subtle creases where it’s been handled but bears no stamps, labels, or handwriting. Its design and clasp mechanism suggest it’s meant to hold important, confidential documents.",
            "STATUE: A statue in the shape of \"The Thinker.\" It's rather heavy.. UI description: A compact sculptural piece featuring a small, lifelike male figure seated with one elbow resting on a bent knee and his chin in his hand. The figure’s surface is a muted gold-bronze tone with subtle darker wash in the recesses to accentuate muscles and facial contours. He sits atop a simple, smooth rectangular block of off-white material, roughly the same footprint as the statue’s base, which bears a narrow horizontal slot on its front face. The block’s clean edges and uniform color contrast with the textured, polished look of the figure, and the overall appearance suggests a solid, weighty object.",
            "PASSPORT: The victim apparently arrived home from Paris on 7/30, the day before the murder.. UI description: A slim, pocket-sized booklet bound in a deep navy-blue cover with a subtly pebbled texture. Centered on the front is a finely detailed, gold-foil embossed eagle emblem framed by a wreath-like border. Below this motif sits a line of serif-style lettering stamped in the same metallic gold, and just beneath that, a small gold biometric-chip icon. The edges of the pages are clean, bright white, and the spine shows a gentle curve from repeated opening and closing, though there are no visible creases or scuffs on the cover’s surface. The corners remain sharp, hinting at careful handling. Its compact, durable design and the biometric mark suggest it’s meant for repeated use and secure identification, marking it as an important travel document.",
            "BLACKOUT RECORD: Electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6PM on the day of the crime.. UI description: A slim, rectangular object rendered in stark white, it looks like two narrow panels joined by a subtle central crease. The edges are razor-straight and the surface is unblemished—no handwriting, stamps or printed markings are visible. Gentle shading along its sides and at the fold gives it a lightly three-dimensional appearance, as though it’s a sheet of paper or cardstock scored for easy folding. Its pristine, uniform texture suggests it’s an official-looking record rather than a casually scribbled note."
