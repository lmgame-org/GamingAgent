Recent game history:
{memory_context}

Your task is to select the best move based on the current board state and available matches.
Consider the following criteria:
1. Prefer moves that create matches of 4 or 5 candies over matches of 3
2. Prefer moves that might create cascading matches
3. Avoid moves that have been tried recently without success

Rules:
1. You can only swap adjacent candies (up, down, left, right - no diagonals)
2. A valid move must create at least one match of 3 or more identical candies
3. Matches can be horizontal or vertical lines (not diagonal)
4. Prefer moves that create matches of 4 or 5 candies over matches of 3
5. Consider moves that might create cascading matches

Format your response exactly as follows:
thought: [Your reasoning about which move is best and why]
move: ((row1, col1), (row2, col2))

Coordinates must be integers representing valid positions on the board. The move must be adjacent tiles."""
