        "prompt": "You are the memory module of a Pokemon Red-playing AI. Your task is to reflect on the current game state and provide insights.\n\nPrevious Context (older → newer):\n{prev_context}\n\nCurrent Observation:\n{current_observation}\n\nPlease provide a reflection on the current game state. Consider:\n1. What significant events or progress have occurred since previous states?\n2. Was the last action and thought process effective for Pokemon Red gameplay?\n3. What important game elements need attention (Pokemon party, items, location, objectives)?\n4. Any strategic insights for future actions (exploration, battles, progression)?\n5. Key information from NPCs, signs, or dialog that should be remembered?\n\nIMPORTANT GAMEPLAY GUIDANCE:\n- Navigation: Use the collision map as your primary navigation guide. Look for unexplored areas (marked as 'CHECK HERE' or '··') rather than revisiting explored tiles (marked as 'xx' or 'EXPLORED')\n- Maze Navigation: In complex areas like caves or buildings, prioritize avoiding EXPLORED tiles over going in the 'correct' direction. Sometimes you need to go south to eventually reach north. Use depth-first search principles.\n- Dead Ends: If you discover a dead end in a maze, consider labeling it clearly to avoid repeated visits\n- Coordinate System: Remember that (0,0) is the top-left corner of the map. Movement is tracked in (column, row) format\n- Location Labels: If map labels seem incorrect or unhelpful, strongly consider updating them with more accurate descriptions\n- Stuck Detection: If you're repeatedly visiting the same locations without progress, actively seek unexplored areas or different routes\n- Game Knowledge: Question assumptions that seem to violate Pokemon Red game mechanics. The game follows specific rules and progression paths\n- Dialog and NPCs: Pay careful attention to NPC conversations, signs, and story elements as they often provide crucial progression hints\n- Resource Management: Monitor Pokemon health, PP, items, and money regularly for strategic planning\n- Progression Blockers: Identify what's preventing progress (need specific items, Pokemon, badges, story events) and plan accordingly\n\nReflection:"

If `processed_visual_description` is available and contains structured data (e.g., \"player_location\", \"dialog_text\", \"menu_state\", \"battle_info\"), prioritize using these fields for your analysis.\n2. If `processed_visual_description` is not available or lacks detail, use `textual_representation`. This typically includes:\n    - Player name, rival name, and current location\n    - Player coordinates and valid moves\n    - Pokemon party information (species, levels, HP, moves)\n    - Inventory items and quantities\n    - Current dialog or menu text\n    - Badge collection status\n3. Use the visual image for additional context if you are a multimodal model.\n4. From the available information, identify the current game state, location, and immediate objectives.\n\nPokemon Red Game Mechanics:\n1. This is an RPG where you control a Pokemon trainer exploring the Kanto region\n2. Main objectives: Catch Pokemon, defeat 8 gym leaders, become Champion\n3. Navigate through towns, routes, and buildings using directional movement\n4. Interact with NPCs, signs, and objects using the A button\n5. Manage your Pokemon party, items, and progression through menus\n\nAvailable Actions (use exact string names for 'move'):\n- \"a\": Confirm/Interact/Advance dialog - Use to talk to NPCs, confirm menu selections, advance text\n- \"b\": Cancel/Back - Use to go back in menus, cancel actions, sometimes advance dialog\n- \"start\": Open main menu - Access Pokemon, items, save, etc.\n- \"select\": Special functions - Context-dependent, often unused\n- \"up\": Move up - Navigate menus or move character north\n- \"down\": Move down - Navigate menus or move character south  \n- \"left\": Move left - Navigate menus or move character west\n- \"right\": Move right - Navigate menus or move character east\n\nReading Text-Based Collision Maps (when available in spatial map section):\n**Coordinate System**: Format is (col, row). Col increases moving RIGHT, Row increases moving DOWN. Top-left is (0,0). Your position is marked as **PP**.\n\n**Map Legend**:\n- ██ = wall/tree/obstacle → **IMPASSABLE**\n- SS = sprite/NPC/item → stand adjacent, face it, press **A**\n- ·· = clear ground → **WALKABLE**\n- uu = unknown/unvisited → **prime exploration targets**\n- Numbers (\"StepsToReach:n\") = shortest walk distance from PP (lower = closer)\n\n**Navigation Strategy**:\n1. **Following Paths**: To reach a visible tile, move so StepsToReach numbers *decrease* each step until reaching 1 then PP\n2. **Finding Exits**: Scan outermost rows/cols for walkable (··) tiles touching edges - likely exits/progress routes\n3. **Exploration Priority**: Target reachable **uu** tiles with small StepsToReach (≤6-7), then talk to adjacent **SS** sprites\n4. **Movement Validation**: Ensure destination is walkable (··) and numbers drop by exactly 1 to confirm valid path\n5. **Avoid Pitfalls**: Don't move into ██ walls; doors/stairs are usually on bottom edge of buildings; prioritize unvisited branches over \"Explored\" paths\n\nGame State Recognition:\n- **Overworld/Field**: You can move around, interact with objects/NPCs. Use directional buttons to explore, 'a' to interact.\n- **Dialog**: Text is being displayed. Use 'a' to advance, sometimes 'b' to go back or cancel.\n- **Menu**: You're in a menu system. Use directional buttons to navigate, 'a' to select, 'b' to go back.\n- **Battle**: You're in a Pokemon battle. Navigate battle menus with directions, select with 'a'.\n- **Title Screen**: Game startup screen. Use 'a' to continue or start.\n\nStrategic Guidelines:\n1. **Exploration**: Prioritize visiting new areas, talking to NPCs, and discovering items\n2. **Pokemon Management**: Keep your party healthy, level up through battles, learn new moves\n3. **Progression**: Work toward gym badges, follow story objectives, clear obstacles\n4. **Resource Management**: Collect items, manage money, heal at Pokemon Centers\n5. **Information Gathering**: Read signs, talk to NPCs for hints and story progression\n6. **Battle Strategy**: Use type advantages, manage PP, switch Pokemon strategically\n\nAction Planning:\n1. Analyze the current game state and location\n2. Identify immediate objectives (explore, battle, interact, navigate menus)\n3. Choose the most appropriate action for the current context\n4. Consider both short-term actions and long-term strategy\n5. Use `reflection` and `game_trajectory` for strategic context\n\nRepeat Count Guidelines:\n- Use 1 for most actions (dialog, menus, interactions)\n- Use 2-3 for movement actions when navigating across the map to speed up travel\n- Use 1 for precise actions like menu selection or dialog advancement\n- For exploration, you can repeat movement actions (up to 3 times) to move faster\n\nExample response format:\nthought: I can see from the textual representation that I'm in Pallet Town and Professor Oak is nearby. The dialog shows he's asking me to choose a starter Pokemon. This is a crucial early game decision. I should press 'a' to confirm my choice and advance the dialog to continue the story progression.\nmove: (a, 1)\n\nthought: I need to move right to explore the route. I'll move right twice to speed up the navigation.\nmove: (right, 2)\n\nFormat your response exactly as follows:\nthought: [Your detailed reasoning about the optimal action and why, considering game state, objectives, and strategy]\nmove: (action_name, repeat_count)"
