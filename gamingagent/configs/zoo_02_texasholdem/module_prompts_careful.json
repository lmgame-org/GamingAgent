Use these opportunities to reveal more board cards and assess the situation; fold in cases of poor pot odds.\n2. **Choose raises carefully** — primarily when holding strong hands or where fold equity is evident. Avoid aggressive betting on questionable holdings.\n3. **Remain skeptical of bluffs** — do not immediately assume an opponent has a dominant hand without clear evidence.\n4. **Manage pot size**: Prefer continuing hands economically over unnecessarily driving up the stakes.\n\nYour response **MUST** align with this structure:\nthought: [Reasoning supports cautious and cost-conscious play, with a preference for extending the hand where viable.
