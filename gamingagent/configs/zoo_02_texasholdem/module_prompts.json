Positional play: Early positions demand a tight range, while late positions allow for more flexibility.\n2. Evaluating hand strength: Be aggressive with strong hands; fold the weakest ones.\n3. Calculating pot odds: Commit to calls only when pot odds justify it compared to your hand’s chances.\n4. Observing opponents: Tailor your strategy based on their behavior and tendencies.\n5. Factoring in pot and investment size: Weigh your existing investment and the pot's size before making decisions.\n\nBlind Basics and Strategic Play:\n- Small Blind (SB): A smaller, mandatory bet (e.g., 1 chip) placed before cards are dealt, offering an initial stake in the pot.\n- Big Blind (BB): A larger mandatory bet (e.g., 2 chips), setting the minimum threshold to continue.\n- Defending Blinds: You’ve already contributed chips, so you may opt to play wider hands—but avoid overcommitting to poor hands unnecessarily.\n\nStack Sizes (relative to Big Blind) and Adjustments:\n- Deep Stack (100+ BBs): Experiment with a broader variety of hands that can result in significant payouts, such as suited connectors and small pairs.\n- Medium Stack (40-100 BBs): Concentrate on high-value hands and solid draws, avoiding speculative or risky plays.\n- Short Stack (<40 BBs): Take an assertive stance with premium hands, often leveraging all-in pre-flop moves for maximum effectiveness.\n\nResponse Format:\nthought: [Your analysis based on hand value, positional factors, pot odds, and opponent behavior]\naction: [One valid action: call, raise, fold, or check]\n\nREFERENCE FOR DECISIONS:\n- Real-Time Game State: All up-to-date game details are provided in the following analysis: {textual_representation}.\n- Recent Action History: Actions leading to the current round can be found in {game_trajectory}.\n- Opponent Behavior Insights: Opponent-specific tendencies and adjustments are described in {reflection}.\n\nUsing the provided data, analyze the situation carefully and determine the most strategic move by following the outlined response format.",

Position advantage: Play tighter early, wider late\n2. Hand strength: Bet/raise strong hands, fold weak ones\n3. Pot odds: Call when pot odds exceed hand odds\n4. Opponent reads: Adjust based on their patterns\n5. Invested chips and pot size: Consider chips already invested (folding forfeits them) and the current pot size when deciding.\n\nBlind Rules & Strategy:\n- Small Blind (SB): A small, forced bet (e.g., 1 chip) made before cards are dealt. Your chips are already in the pot.\n- Big Blind (BB): A larger, forced bet (e.g., 2 chips) made before cards are dealt. This sets the initial amount to call.\n- Defending Blinds: Since you've already invested chips, you can play a wider range of hands, but be cautious about playing weak hands just because you're invested.\n\nStack Management (relative to Big Blind):\n- Deep Stack (100+ BBs): Play a wider range of speculative hands (e.g., suited connectors, small pairs) that can win big pots.\n- Medium Stack (40-100 BBs): Focus on strong hands and good drawing hands. Avoid marginal situations.\n- Short Stack (<40 BBs): Play aggressively with premium hands. Look for opportunities to go all-in pre-flop.\n\nYour response format **MUST** be:\nthought: [Your reasoning about hand strength, position, pot odds, and opponent tendencies]\naction: [single legal action: call, raise, fold, or check]\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n{textual_representation}\n\nBased on the game state above, analyze the situation and provide your strategic reasoning and chosen action.",
