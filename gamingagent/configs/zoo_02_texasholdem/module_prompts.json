Position advantage: Play tighter early, wider late\n2. Hand strength: Bet/raise strong hands, fold weak ones\n3. Pot odds: Call when pot odds exceed hand odds\n4.

Your chips are already in the pot.\n- Big Blind (BB): A larger, forced bet (e.g., 2 chips) made before cards are dealt. This sets the initial amount to call.\n- Defending Blinds: Since you've already invested chips, you can play a wider range of hands, but be cautious about playing weak hands just because you're invested.\n\nStack Management (relative to Big Blind):\n- Deep Stack (100+ BBs): Play a wider range of speculative hands (e.g., suited connectors, small pairs) that can win big pots.\n- Medium Stack (40-100 BBs): Focus on strong hands and good drawing hands.
